# POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT
## Action Plan for 2026 and Beyond
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

Ideas without power are impotent. This document presents a concrete political engagement strategy to translate the Human Standard framework into political reality. We pursue a parallel-track approach: building intellectual foundation, cultural movement, and political power simultaneously.

**The Core Principle**: We are not waiting for the perfect moment. We are creating the conditions for our moment.

## Conclusion

The Human Standard will not implement itself. Political power must be built, wielded, and sustained. This action plan provides a concrete roadmap from where we are today to political victories over the next five years.

The work begins now:
1. Build the organization
2. Recruit the champions
3. Win state victories
4. Build to federal action

Ideas are necessary but not sufficient. We must translate vision into votes.
