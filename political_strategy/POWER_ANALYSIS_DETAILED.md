# DETAILED POWER ANALYSIS
## Understanding Friends, Enemies, and Strategy
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

Political success requires understanding the landscape of power. This document maps allies, opponents, and neutrals for the Human Standard agenda, assessing their interests, power, and potential for engagement. Effective strategy requires dividing opponents, sequencing battles, and building unexpected coalitions.

**The Core Principle**: No policy succeeds without political power. Power analysis is not cynical—it's necessary.

## Part IV: Opponent Strategy

### Divide and Conquer

**Split Big Tech**:
| Company Type | Interest | Approach |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Ad-driven (Google, Meta) | Oppose data tax | Primary target |
| Hardware + Services (Apple) | Less exposed to data tax | Potential neutral/ally |
| AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic) | Mixed (safety interests) | Engage on governance |
| Enterprise software (Microsoft) | Mixed | Engage on AI governance |

**Split Finance**:
| Sector | Interest | Approach |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Traditional banks | Oppose sound money | Primary target |
| Crypto-native firms | Support sound money | Ally |
| Asset managers (some) | Follow trends | Persuadable |

### Neutralize Key Opponents

**Public Sector Unions**:
- Offer: Generous buyouts (5+ years salary), guaranteed transition support, early retirement options
- Frame: "We're not cutting jobs, we're offering a better deal"
- Target: Rank and file may accept even if leadership opposes

**Real Estate**:
- Strategy: Delay LVT to Phase 3
- Frame: LVT as "property tax reform" not "new tax"
- Offset: Property tax elimination in exchange for LVT

**Defense Industry**:
- Strategy: Separate AI weapons ethics from economic agenda
- Reality: They'll oppose anyway, but don't give them coalition opportunity

## Part V: Coalition Building

### The Core Coalition

**First Ring: Economic Security**
- Displaced workers (core constituency)
- Gig workers (growing, precarious)
- Service workers (automation-threatened)
- Young workers (housing, opportunity)

**Second Ring: Technology Ethics**
- AI safety researchers (expertise)
- Tech workers with conscience (insider legitimacy)
- Digital rights advocates (privacy, fairness)
- Open source community (transparency values)

**Third Ring: Economic Reform**
- Citizen's Royalty advocates (policy alignment)
- Progressive economists (intellectual support)
- Anti-monopoly movement (tech regulation)
- Climate-economy bridge (just transition)

**Fourth Ring: Values Voters**
- Religious communities (human dignity)
- Care advocates (valuing unpaid work)

**To Populists**: "Anti-elite + anti-Big Tech + power to people"
**To Workers**: "Security + fair share + transition support"
**To Young People**: "Afford housing + build future + climate action"

## Part VI: Sequencing Strategy

### Phase 1: Low Resistance, Build Momentum (Years 1-3)

| Policy | Opposition Level | Purpose |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Automation disclosure | Low | Build data, establish principle |
| Transition support | Low | Help visible victims |
| AI safety standards | Medium | Reasonable, bipartisan appeal |
| Training data rights | Medium | Pro-creator, popular |

**Avoid in Phase 1**:
- Full automation tax (wait for disclosure data)
- LVT (delay for coalition building)
- AI weapons (separate issue)

### Phase 2: Build on Success (Years 3-5)

| Policy | Opposition Level | Prerequisite |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Automation tax (initial) | Medium-High | Disclosure data shows need |
| Sovereign wealth fund | Medium | Framework established |
| Citizen's Royalty pilots | Medium | Transition support proves concept |
| AI governance (expanded) | Medium | Safety standards accepted |

### Phase 3: Full Implementation (Years 5-10)

| Policy | Opposition Level | Strategy |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Full automation tax | High | Coalition built, evidence compelling |
| National Citizen's Royalty | High | Pilots successful, demand high |
| LVT | High | Other victories built power |
| Sound money expansion | Medium | Crypto normalized |

### What Not To Do

- Don't bundle everything together (creates united opposition)
- Don't lead with most controversial (LVT, AI weapons)
- Don't attack all opponents simultaneously
- Don't neglect relationship building for electoral fights

**Wild Card**: AGI arrives fast, emergency action required

## Conclusion

Power analysis is not cynical—it's necessary. Understanding who supports us, who opposes us, and why enables effective strategy.

Key takeaways:
1. **Divide opponents** (Big Tech, finance have internal splits)
2. **Sequence carefully** (start with low resistance, build power)
3. **Build strange coalitions** (libertarian + progressive on cash transfers)
4. **Cultivate champions** (political, thought leader, organizational)
5. **Win at state level** (build proof, generate momentum)

The Human Standard is not just morally right—it can be politically successful. But only with clear-eyed assessment and strategic execution.
