# THE CITIZEN'S ROYALTY
## Everyone Gets a Share

---

### The Problem

AI and robots will do most jobs better and cheaper than humans. This isn't decades away—it's happening now. Without intervention, this creates two classes: those who own the machines, and those who got replaced by them.

### The Solution

**The Citizen's Royalty** ensures everyone benefits from technological progress. We tax machine productivity, guarantee every citizen a $24,000/year income floor via Negative Income Tax, and invest surplus in the Sovereign Humanity Fund for long-term sustainability.

### How It Works

- **Automation Tax**: When machines replace human work, companies contribute to the Citizen's Royalty fund
- **Negative Income Tax**: Everyone is guaranteed a $24,000/year income floor—those earning less receive the difference
- **Sovereign Humanity Fund**: Surplus revenue is invested (like Alaska's Permanent Fund) for long-term sustainability

### Why This Is Different

- **Not welfare**—it's your share of what the machines produce
- **Not anti-technology**—we embrace automation, we just share the gains
- **Not left or right**—it's about ensuring everyone has a stake in the future

### The Numbers

| Phase | Timeline | Monthly Dividend |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Pilot | Years 1-3 | $1,250 ($15K floor) |
| Expansion | Years 3-7 | $1,500 ($18K floor) |
| Maturity | Years 7-15 | $2,000 ($24K floor) |

### The Core Principle

> *You built this economy. You trained the AI on your data. You deserve a stake in the automated future.*
