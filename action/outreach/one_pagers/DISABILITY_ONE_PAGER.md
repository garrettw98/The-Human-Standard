# DISABILITY RIGHTS IN THE AUTOMATION AGE
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

## THE PROBLEM

- The current disability system is cruel -- it forces people to prove their suffering to bureaucrats, penalizes any attempt to work, and creates poverty traps that are nearly impossible to escape
- Benefits are inadequate: the average SSI payment is roughly $700/month, well below the poverty line
- The system treats disability as suspicious rather than human -- requiring endless documentation, repeated evaluations, and degrading interrogations
- 61 million Americans live with a disability; millions more are caregivers
- Benefit cliffs mean that earning even a small income can trigger total loss of support, housing, and healthcare
- AI and automation are being deployed without accessibility requirements, creating new barriers

## THE SOLUTION

**The Citizen's Royalty eliminates the worst traps. A universal floor means no one needs to "prove" they cannot work.**

Under The Human Standard, every American receives the Citizen's Royalty regardless of ability or disability status. Disability-specific services -- healthcare, assistive technology, personal care, accommodations -- continue ON TOP of the Citizen's Royalty, not as a replacement. The universal floor removes the need for the degrading means-testing that defines the current system.

## KEY POLICIES

### Economic Security
- **Citizen's Royalty stacks with disability-specific services** -- it is an addition, never a replacement
- **Elimination of benefit cliffs** -- no more losing everything because you earned $20 too much
- **Employment support without punishment** -- people with disabilities can work as much or as little as they choose without risking their baseline support

### Technology Access
- **Accessible technology mandates for all AI systems** -- any AI deployed in hiring, healthcare, education, or public services must meet accessibility standards
- **ADA extension to AI systems** -- algorithmic accommodation as a legal right, ensuring AI does not discriminate against people with disabilities
- **Disability-informed AI design** -- people with disabilities involved in design, testing, and oversight of AI systems that affect their lives

### Healthcare and Services
- **Guaranteed access to assistive technology** regardless of income
- **Expanded home and community-based services** -- support people where they live, not in institutions
- **Caregiver compensation** -- the Citizen's Royalty recognizes the essential work of caregivers

---

## WHO BENEFITS

- **61 million Americans with disabilities** -- economic security without degradation
- **Caregivers and families** -- financial support for the essential work they already do
- **Workers with disabilities** -- freedom to work without fear of losing benefits
- **Employers** -- a larger, more diverse talent pool with reduced accommodation barriers
- **Everyone** -- disability is a human condition that most people will experience at some point in their lives

## COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"Won't people fake disability to get more benefits?"**
The Citizen's Royalty is universal -- everyone receives it regardless of disability status. There is no incentive to fake anything. Disability-specific services address genuine needs that non-disabled people do not have.

**"This is too expensive"**
The current system costs more through emergency care, institutionalization, lost productivity, and massive bureaucratic overhead. Poverty is expensive. Dignity is cheaper.

**"People with disabilities should work if they can"**
We agree. That is exactly why we eliminate benefit cliffs and employment penalties. The current system punishes people with disabilities for working. The Human Standard removes the punishment.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

Disability is a human condition, not a moral failing. The current system forces people to choose between survival and dignity. The automation age should liberate people with disabilities -- through economic security, accessible technology, and the elimination of bureaucratic cruelty -- not further marginalize them. The Human Standard builds a floor that no one falls through.
