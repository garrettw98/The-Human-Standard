# EDUCATION & WORKFORCE TRANSITION
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

## THE PROBLEM

- The education system was designed for the industrial age -- it is not preparing people for the automation age
- 45 million Americans carry $1.7 trillion in student debt for degrees that may not lead to stable careers
- Government retraining programs have a dismal track record -- most displaced workers never return to prior earnings
- The average American will need to change careers (not just jobs) multiple times in a lifetime
- Education is treated as a one-time event that ends in your twenties, not the lifelong necessity it has become

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Lifelong learning as a right, not a privilege. Education that adapts as fast as the economy does.**

The Human Standard treats education and workforce transition as permanent infrastructure -- not a one-time purchase, but a continuous public investment in human capability.

---

## KEY POLICIES

### Early Investment
- **Universal Pre-K** for all children ages 3-5 (every $1 invested returns $7-12)
- **K-12 curriculum modernization** focused on adaptability, critical thinking, and technical literacy

### Affordable Pathways
- **Free community college and trade schools** -- no tuition for two-year degrees, certifications, and apprenticeships
- **Student debt restructuring** -- income-based repayment capped at 10% of income, forgiveness after 20 years, immediate relief for those in default

### Lifelong Learning Infrastructure
- **Continuous Learning Accounts** -- $5,000/year deposited for every American adult, usable for accredited education, certifications, and skills training at any age
- **Employer Transition Funds** -- companies that automate jobs contribute to retraining the workers they displace

### Displacement Protection
- **Automation Displacement Insurance** -- 80% of prior wage for up to 2 years while retraining, available to any worker whose job is eliminated by automation
- **Credential portability** -- national recognition of certifications across state lines and industries

## WHO BENEFITS

- **Displaced workers** -- real income support while building new skills, not a cliff into poverty
- **Young people** -- debt-free pathways to careers that actually exist
- **Career changers** -- financial support to pivot at 35, 45, or 55 without risking everything
- **Employers** -- access to a continuously skilled workforce ready for new roles
- **The economy** -- productive workers generate growth; idle workers do not

## COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"This is too expensive"**
It is an investment, not an expense. Every dollar in early education returns $7-12. Every displaced worker who stays productive keeps paying taxes instead of drawing benefits. The cost of NOT investing is higher.

**"People should pay for their own education"**
They already do -- through taxes, through lost wages during school, through decades of debt. We publicly fund K-12 because we recognize the public benefit. The automation age demands we extend that logic.

**"Retraining doesn't work"**
Current retraining fails because it offers classes without income support. People cannot learn new skills while worrying about rent. Automation Displacement Insurance solves this.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

The automation age demands continuous learning. We cannot ask people to adapt to a radically changing economy while saddling them with debt, offering inadequate retraining, and treating education as a product instead of infrastructure. The Human Standard makes lifelong learning possible for everyone.
