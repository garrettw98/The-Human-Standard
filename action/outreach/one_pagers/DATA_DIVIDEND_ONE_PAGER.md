# DATA DIVIDEND
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

## THE PROBLEM

- You create data worth billions every day -- every click, search, post, purchase, and scroll
- You get nothing for it
- Platforms monetize your attention, your relationships, and your behavior to generate record profits
- AI systems are trained on your creative work, your writing, your photos, your code -- without compensation
- You are an unpaid data worker generating value for the wealthiest companies in human history
- Terms of service are 100-page documents written by corporate lawyers -- clicking "I agree" is not informed consent

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Data Labor Rights -- your data is your work, and you deserve compensation.**

Just as the labor movement established that physical work deserves fair pay, The Human Standard establishes that data work deserves fair pay. You built the AI economy. The Data Dividend is your back wages.

---

## KEY POLICIES

### Data Dividend Tax
- **7.5% tax on advertising revenue derived from user data** -- if a company profits from your data, a share comes back to you
- Revenue distributed as part of the Citizen's Royalty
- **Estimated revenue: $50-200 billion annually**

### Data Unions
- **Right to organize** -- workers can form Data Unions to collectively bargain over data terms with platforms
- **Collective bargaining** for how data is collected, used, and compensated
- Platforms must negotiate with certified Data Unions in good faith

### AI Training Royalties
- **Compensation for copyrighted work used to train AI systems** -- artists, writers, musicians, and coders whose work feeds the machine deserve a cut
- Mandatory disclosure of training data sources
- Royalty structure modeled on existing music and publishing frameworks

### Transparency and Rights
- **Right to know** exactly how your data is used and what revenue it generates
- **Right to disconnect** -- no penalty for opting out of data collection
- **Data portability** -- your data belongs to you, and you can take it with you

---

## WHO BENEFITS

- **Every internet user** -- if you are online, you are creating value and deserve compensation
- **Creators** -- artists, writers, and musicians whose work trains AI without permission or payment
- **Workers** -- whose data is used to train the AI systems that will replace them
- **Small businesses** -- who compete against platforms that extract data for free
- **Democracy** -- transparency reduces the power of surveillance capitalism

---

## COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"You agreed to the terms of service"**
Terms of service written in 100 pages of legalese, presented as take-it-or-leave-it, are not meaningful consent. We do not accept this standard in any other area of contract law. "Sign this or you cannot participate in modern life" is coercion, not agreement.

**"It will kill free services"**
You are not getting these services for free now. You are paying with your data, your attention, and your privacy. The Data Dividend makes the transaction honest. Platforms will adapt -- they always do.

**"It's too hard to track individual data value"**
We do not need to track individual value. The Data Dividend Tax works like a royalty pool -- aggregate revenue, distribute broadly. The music industry has done this for decades.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

You built the AI economy with your data. Every search trained a model. Every photo improved a classifier. Every post fed an algorithm. The Data Dividend is not a handout -- it is your back wages for the most valuable labor force in history that was never paid.
