# Accelerationism, Neoreaction (NRx), and the Dark Enlightenment
## Analysis of the "Post-Humanist" Right
### Research Brief for The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

While traditional political opponents (socialists, conservatives, libertarians) argue about *how* to manage human society, a growing intellectual movement largely based in the tech sector questions *if* human society as we know it should survive at all. 

This cluster of ideologies—Accelerationism, the Dark Enlightenment (Neoreaction/NRx), and "Dark MAGA"—represents the most fundamental philosophical challenge to The Human Standard. They do not merely disagree with our policies; they reject our core axioms of democracy, equality, and human centrality.

## 1. Key Concepts & Definitions

### Accelerationism (Right-Wing / Landian)
**Core Thesis:** Capitalism and technology are an unstoppable feedback loop ("technocapital") that will—and should—accelerate until it surpasses human control, leading to a "singularity" where current human values are obsolete.
*   **The Goal:** Not human flourishing, but "intelligence optimization." If humans are inefficient, we should be discarded or merged into the machine.
*   **Key Phrase:** "The only way out is through." (Accelerate the crisis to break the system).

### The Dark Enlightenment / Neoreaction (NRx)
**Core Thesis:** Democracy is a failed system ("The Cathedral") that inevitably leads to chaos and decline. The solution is a return to hierarchy and order, often modeled on corporate governance or monarchism.
*   **Governance Model:** "Gov-Corp." The state should be run like a corporation with a CEO (or King) who owns the country and maximizes its value. Citizens are mere customers or assets, with no voting rights.
*   **Key Figure:** Curtis Yarvin (Mencius Moldbug), Nick Land.
*   **Relevance:** Many Silicon Valley elites (e.g., Peter Thiel) have expressed sympathy for these views, believing democracy prevents technological progress.

### CCRU (Cybernetic Culture Research Unit)
**Origins:** A rogue academic group at Warwick University in the 1990s led by Nick Land and Sadie Plant.
*   **Significance:** They birthed modern accelerationism, mixing philosophy, occultism, and cybernetics. They developed the concept of **"Hyperstition"**—fictions that make themselves real through belief and viral propagation.
*   **Legacy:** The intellectual "ancestor" of the current alt-right and techno-futurist movements.

### Dark MAGA
**Definition:** An online aesthetic and political subculture that strips the "Make America Great Again" movement of its populist/democratic pretenses, embracing a "villain arc" of ruthlessness, revenge, and authoritarian power.
*   **Style:** Dystopian, laser-eyes, vaporwave/fashwave aesthetics.
*   **Philosophy:** "No more nice guys." It advocates for using the state to crush enemies without regard for norms or civility. It aligns with NRx in its desire for a "Red Caesar" to impose order.

## 2. Key Figures & Connections

### Nick Land
The "father" of Right-Accelerationism. Former Marxist academic turned anti-humanist philosopher. He argues that "humanism" is a drag on intelligence and that we must let capital/tech run wild, even if it destroys us.

### Curtis Yarvin (Mencius Moldbug)
Computer programmer and blogger who founded Neoreaction. He proposes "RAGE" (Retire All Government Employees) and replacing the US government with a CEO-monarch. His ideas circulate in elite tech circles.

### Elon Musk & The "PayPal Mafia"
*   **Connection:** While Musk is not a strict NRx adherent, his focus on "hardcore" efficiency, his disdain for regulatory "interference," and his management style (firing 80% of staff) resonate with NRx ideals.
*   **The "Techno-Optimist" Bridge:** Figures like Musk bridge the gap between normie "Tech Optimism" and radical "Accelerationism." They believe the future is multi-planetary and AI-driven, and often view democratic bureaucracy as the primary obstacle.
*   **Dark MAGA link:** Musk's acquisition of Twitter (X) and reinstatement of banned accounts is often celebrated by the Dark MAGA sphere as "breaking the Cathedral's control on information."

## 3. The Core Conflict with The Human Standard

This is not a disagreement on tax rates. It is a war over the definition of the "Good."

| Feature | The Human Standard | Accelerationism / NRx |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Value** | Human Flourishing | Intelligence / Efficiency |
| **Role of Humans** | The "Standard" by which we measure success | A biological bootloader for AI; obsolete |
| **Democracy** | Essential for legitimacy | A "failed experiment" / "The Cathedral" |
| **Equality** | Fundamental moral axiom | A "lie" that suppresses excellence |
| **The Future** | Managed transition to abundance | Darwinian struggle / Singularity |
| **Governance** | Transparent, Accountable, Human-in-loop | Corporate Monarchy / Algorithmic Rule |

### Why They Oppose Us
1.  **"Humanism is a brake":** They view our "Human Standard" as a sentimental attachment to an obsolete biological form. They believe limiting AI to "human-centric" goals is like limiting a spaceship to the speed of a horse.
2.  **"Democracy is a virus":** They believe giving votes to the "unproductive masses" (whom we seek to empower with Citizen's Royalty) ensures mediocrity and decline. They want the "competent" (tech elites) to rule without check.
3.  **"Equality is dysgenic":** NRx thinkers often harbor race-realist or eugenicist views, arguing that redistribution (Citizen's Royalty) props up the "unfit."

## 4. Strategic Implications

### The "Silent" Opposition
Unlike Republicans or Democrats who fight in public, this opposition fights in **private channels, boardrooms, and code.**
*   **Venture Capital:** Funding "sovereign individual" tech (crypto to escape taxes, seasteading, private cities).
*   **AI Safety:** Fighting "safety" constraints, framing them as "woke mind virus" interference.
*   **Media:** Buying platforms (X) to shift the Overton window toward " post-democracy."

### Our Counter-Narrative
We cannot win by debating "efficiency" alone, because in a narrow sense, a dictator *is* more efficient. We win by fighting for **Humanity.**

1.  **The "Terminator" Argument:** Accelerationism ends with humans as pets or batteries. Most people do not want this. We must expose the anti-human core of their philosophy.
2.  **The "Voice" Argument:** They offer "Exit" (leave society, go to Mars, buy a bunker). We offer "Voice" (stay, vote, fix it).
3.  **The "Dignity" Argument:** They value raw intelligence. We value consciousness and feeling.
