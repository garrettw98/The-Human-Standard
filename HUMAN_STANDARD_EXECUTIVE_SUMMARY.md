## The Challenge

We are witnessing the most significant economic transformation since industrialization. Artificial intelligence and robotics are rapidly acquiring the capability to perform both cognitive and physical labor—tasks that, until now, required human workers.

This transformation could unfold in two very different ways:

**Scenario A: Concentrated Gains**
- Automation benefits flow primarily to capital owners
- Displaced workers compete for shrinking pool of jobs
- Inequality reaches unprecedented levels
- Social and political instability follows

**Scenario B: Shared Prosperity**
- Automation benefits are distributed to all citizens
- Displacement becomes liberation from drudgery
- Everyone has a stake in technological progress
- Society remains cohesive and stable

The difference between these scenarios is not technological—it's political. It depends on the systems we build now.

---

## Our Proposal: The Automation Dividend

We propose a comprehensive framework to ensure Scenario B becomes reality. The core mechanism is simple:

1. **Tax automation productivity** (not technology itself, but the economic value it generates)
2. **Invest revenue in a sovereign wealth fund** (building permanent national wealth)
3. **Distribute returns as citizen dividends** (everyone gets a share)

This is not welfare. It is recognition that technological progress builds on collective infrastructure—education, legal systems, public research, the data we all generate—and the returns should be partially collective.

## The Funding Architecture

### Revenue Sources (No Federal VAT Required)

| Source | Mechanism | Annual Revenue |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Automation Productivity Tax | Tax on productivity gains above industry baseline | $75-200B |
| Land Value Tax | 2% annual tax on land value | $500-800B |
| Financial Transaction Tax | 0.1% on securities trades | $150B |
| Carbon Tax | $50/ton, rising over time | $150B |
| Data Dividend Tax | Tax on commercial use of citizen data | $50-100B |
| Inheritance Reform | Close step-up basis loophole | $75B |
| Corporate Loophole Closure | Eliminate tax expenditures | $300B |
| **Total Potential** | | **$1.3-1.8T** |

### The Sovereign Wealth Fund Model

Rather than spending revenue directly, we invest it:

- **Year 1**: Seed fund with $200B (automation taxes + existing assets)
- **Annual additions**: $150-300B from ongoing revenue
- **Investment returns**: Target 7% average annual return
- **Distributions**: Dividends from returns, not principal

**Projected Growth**:
| Year | Fund Size | Annual Dividend (per adult) |
|------|-----------|----------------------------|
| 5 | $800B | $200/month |
| 10 | $2T | $450/month |
| 20 | $5T+ | $1,000+/month |

This model is proven. Alaska's Permanent Fund has operated for 40+ years. Norway's sovereign wealth fund exceeds $1.4 trillion.

## The Policy Framework

### The Five Laws

All policies derive from five foundational principles:

1. **Do No Harm**: No policy may directly cause physical harm or deprive basic necessities
2. **Enable Human Flourishing**: Expand capabilities for health, security, freedom, connection, purpose
3. **Preserve Democratic Legitimacy**: Humans retain authority; AI advises and executes
4. **Maintain Transparency**: All systems affecting citizens must be auditable
5. **Serve All Equally**: No discrimination or special treatment

### The Ten Policy Pillars

| Pillar | Key Elements |
|--------|--------------|
| Economic Justice | Automation tax, data dividend, Citizen's Royalty |
| AI Governance | Tiered transparency, safety requirements, human oversight |
| Sound Money | Bitcoin/crypto as optional savings, inflation protection |
| Truth Infrastructure | Content authentication, identity verification |
| Human Capital | Healthcare, education, workforce transition |
| Climate & Energy | Carbon pricing, renewables, nuclear |
| Criminal Justice | End mass incarceration, restorative justice |
| Housing | YIMBY zoning, land value tax, housing first |
| Immigration | Merit-based with humanitarian protection |
| Defense | AI weapons ethics, alliance modernization |

---

## Addressing Uncertainty

We hold this framework with epistemic humility. Key uncertainties include:

### Automation Timeline

We don't know exactly when displacement will accelerate. We've designed for multiple scenarios:

| Scenario | Timeline | Our Response |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Gradual | 30-50 years | Policies remain beneficial, less urgent |
| Accelerated | 10-20 years | Core framework implemented on schedule |
| Sudden | 5-10 years | Emergency acceleration of implementation |

**Our approach**: Trigger-based implementation. Policies activate based on observable indicators (unemployment rates, productivity gaps) rather than predicted dates.

### What We Might Be Wrong About

- The automation timeline may be slower than expected
- Humans may adapt to work-optional life differently than we predict
- Sound money principles may face challenges we haven't anticipated
- International coordination may prove more difficult than hoped

We've designed for robustness across scenarios and commit to adapting based on evidence.

## Immediate Transition Support

Workers displaced today can't wait 20 years for a mature fund. Immediate support includes:

| Program | Benefit | Eligibility |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Automation Displacement Insurance | 80% of prior wage, 2 years | Laid off due to automation |
| Emergency Citizen's Royalty Pilot | $1,000/month | Regions with >12% tech unemployment |
| Relocation Assistance | $15K + 6 months housing | Moving to opportunity areas |
| Rapid Retraining | Paid at 80% prior wage | 6-24 month programs |

Funded by early-phase automation taxes and reallocation from existing unemployment programs.

---

## Building Community

Work provides more than income—it provides structure, connection, and purpose. We invest in meaning infrastructure:

- **National Service Corps**: Voluntary service opportunities, paid above Citizen's Royalty
- **Community Centers**: Physical spaces for connection ($50B capital investment)
- **Lifelong Learning**: Free adult education beyond job training
- **Arts & Culture**: Support for creative and cultural institutions
- **Civic Participation**: Platforms and funding for democratic engagement

---

## Political Positioning

The Automation Dividend is not left or right. It draws support from:

| Constituency | What We Offer |
|--------------|---------------|
| Displaced workers | Economic security, transition support |
| Young people | Housing affordability, stake in the future |
| Small businesses | Level playing field vs. AI-enabled megacorps |
| Tech workers | Ethical technology, sustainable industry |
| Fiscal conservatives | Sovereign wealth (savings), not deficit spending |
| Social progressives | Universal programs, reduced inequality |

**The Coalition**: Not ideological allies, but people who share material interest in ensuring automation benefits everyone.

---

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-3)
- Pass automation disclosure requirements
- Launch transition support programs
- Establish sovereign wealth fund structure
- Pilot Citizen's Royalty in high-displacement regions

### Phase 2: Building (Years 3-7)
- Implement automation tax (phased)
- Scale transition programs
- Begin fund investments
- First dividend payments

### Phase 3: Maturity (Years 7-15)
- Full automation tax implementation
- Substantial dividend payments ($500+/month)
- Meaning infrastructure operational
- International coordination

### Phase 4: Steady State (Years 15+)
- Fund self-sustaining
- Full dividend ($1,000+/month)
- Work genuinely optional
- Continuous adaptation

## The Ask

We seek:

1. **Intellectual engagement**: Critique our framework, improve it
2. **Coalition building**: Connect with aligned organizations and individuals
3. **Political support**: Candidates who will champion these policies
4. **Public attention**: Coverage that brings these ideas to broader audiences

---

## Conclusion

The automation transformation is coming. We don't know exactly when or how fast, but we know it's real. The question is not whether to respond, but how.

We can wait until crisis hits and improvise badly. Or we can build systems now that ensure everyone benefits from technological progress.

The Automation Dividend is our proposal. It's not perfect—we hold it humbly and will improve it based on evidence and critique. But it represents our best current thinking on how to navigate the most significant economic transformation in human history.

The machines will work. The question is: who gets paid?

## Quick Reference

**One sentence**: Tax automation, invest the revenue, pay everyone a dividend.

**One paragraph**: AI and robots will do most jobs better and cheaper than humans. Without intervention, this concentrates wealth in the hands of machine owners. The Automation Dividend taxes machine productivity, invests revenue in a sovereign wealth fund, and pays every citizen a share of the returns. It's not welfare—it's your stake in the automated economy.

**The core principle**: You built this economy. You trained the AI on your data. You deserve a share of what the machines produce.
