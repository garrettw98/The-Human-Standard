## Detailed Projections of Automation Impact, Citizen's Royalty Effects, and Fiscal Analysis

---

This appendix presents the quantitative backbone of The Human Standard's policy proposals.
Every projection herein is built on publicly available data, peer-reviewed research, and
transparent assumptions. Where uncertainty exists, we say so. Where confidence is high, we
show our work.

## 1. Automation Impact Model

### GDP Growth Projections: With and Without Automation

| Year | Baseline GDP (No Automation Acceleration) | GDP with Automation Acceleration | Difference |
|------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 2025 | $28.5T | $28.8T | +$0.3T |
| 2028 | $31.0T | $32.5T | +$1.5T |
| 2030 | $33.0T | $36.0T | +$3.0T |
| 2035 | $37.5T | $44.0T | +$6.5T |
| 2040 | $42.0T | $54.0T | +$12.0T |
| 2045 | $47.0T | $66.0T | +$19.0T |
| 2050 | $52.0T | $80.0T | +$28.0T |

**Assumptions:** Baseline uses CBO long-term growth estimates (~2% real). Automation scenario
assumes compounding productivity gains of 1.5-3% annually above baseline, accelerating as
AI capabilities mature. All figures in 2024 dollars.

### Sector-by-Sector Displacement Estimates

| Sector | Current Employment | Est. Displacement by 2040 | Displacement Rate | Timeline |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Manufacturing | 12.8M | 5.5-7.0M | 43-55% | Already underway |
| Retail | 15.7M | 6.0-9.0M | 38-57% | 2025-2035 |
| Transportation & Warehousing | 6.5M | 3.5-5.0M | 54-77% | 2028-2038 |
| Administrative & Office Support | 19.5M | 10.0-14.0M | 51-72% | 2025-2035 |
| Professional Services | 23.0M | 5.0-10.0M | 22-43% | 2028-2040 |
| Healthcare (non-clinical) | 8.0M | 2.0-4.0M | 25-50% | 2030-2045 |
| **Total (these sectors)** | **85.5M** | **32.0-49.0M** | **37-57%** | |

**Sources:** Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data; McKinsey Global Institute (2017, 2023);
Frey & Osborne (2013, revised 2023); Acemoglu & Restrepo (2020).

### Productivity Gains by Sector

| Sector | Expected Productivity Gain (by 2040) | Primary Driver |
|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Manufacturing | +60-120% | Robotics, AI quality control |
| Retail | +40-80% | Automated checkout, inventory AI, e-commerce |
| Transportation | +80-150% | Autonomous vehicles, route optimization |
| Administrative | +100-200% | LLMs, document automation, AI scheduling |
| Professional Services | +30-80% | AI-assisted analysis, code generation, legal AI |
| Healthcare | +20-50% | Diagnostic AI, robotic surgery, admin automation |

### Labor Market Transition Curves

Historical precedent suggests displaced workers face three phases:

- **Phase 1 (0-2 years):** Acute displacement. Workers leave roles. Unemployment spikes locally.
- **Phase 2 (2-7 years):** Retraining and reallocation. Some workers transition; many take lower-paying work.
- **Phase 3 (7-15 years):** New equilibrium. New industries absorb some labor. Permanent displacement crystallizes for others.

**Critical difference from prior transitions:** AI automation affects cognitive and physical labor
simultaneously, compresses Phase 1-2 timelines, and may not produce a Phase 3 equilibrium
that absorbs displaced workers at comparable wages.

## 2. Citizen's Royalty Fiscal Model

### Gross Cost Calculation

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| U.S. adult population (18+) | ~260 million | Census Bureau |
| Full monthly benefit | $2,000/month ($24,000/year) | The Human Standard proposal |
| **Gross annual cost at full implementation** | **~$6.24 trillion** | 260M x $24,000 |

### Negative Income Tax Structure Reduces Effective Cost

The Citizen's Royalty is not a flat check to every American regardless of income. The NIT
structure phases out the benefit for high earners, dramatically reducing the real cost:

- Effective cost after NIT phase-out: ~60% of gross = **~$3.74 trillion**
- Tax recapture from high earners (income above $150K): **~$1 trillion**
- Program consolidation offset (SNAP, TANF, SSI, housing vouchers, etc.): **~$1-1.5 trillion**
- **Net new revenue needed: ~$1.24-1.74 trillion at full implementation**

*Note: The net new revenue figure represents the gap between existing federal spending that
would be consolidated and the total effective cost of the program.*

### Phase-In Cost by Year

| Year | Monthly Benefit | Annual per Person | Gross Cost | Effective Cost (after NIT) | Net New Revenue Needed |
|------|----------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | $500 | $6,000 | $1.56T | $0.94T | $0.0-0.2T |
| 2 | $667 | $8,000 | $2.08T | $1.25T | $0.1-0.3T |
| 3 | $833 | $10,000 | $2.60T | $1.56T | $0.2-0.5T |
| 4 | $1,000 | $12,000 | $3.12T | $1.87T | $0.4-0.8T |
| 5 | $1,167 | $14,000 | $3.64T | $2.18T | $0.5-1.0T |
| 6 | $1,333 | $16,000 | $4.16T | $2.50T | $0.7-1.2T |
| 7 | $1,500 | $18,000 | $4.68T | $2.81T | $0.9-1.4T |
| 8 | $1,667 | $20,000 | $5.20T | $3.12T | $1.0-1.5T |
| 9 | $1,833 | $22,000 | $5.72T | $3.43T | $1.1-1.6T |
| 10 | $2,000 | $24,000 | $6.24T | $3.74T | $1.24-1.74T |

**Key insight:** The phase-in buys time. Revenue sources scale alongside the benefit, and
dynamic economic effects compound over the decade.

## 3. Revenue Source Modeling

These are the canonical revenue figures for The Human Standard. All other references in the
book must match these ranges exactly.

| Revenue Source | Annual Revenue Range | Confidence Level | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Automation Productivity Tax | $200-600B | MEDIUM | Tax on net labor savings from automation; scales with adoption |
| Value-Added Tax (10-15%) | $1.5-2.5T | HIGH | Broad-based consumption tax; exemptions for essentials |
| Land Value Tax (2%) | $500B-1T | MEDIUM | Based on total U.S. land value of ~$25-50T; implementation varies |
| Carbon Fee ($50-150/ton) | $200-400B | HIGH | U.S. emits ~5B tons CO2/year; revenue declines as emissions fall |
| Data Dividend Tax | $50-200B | MEDIUM | Tax on commercial use of aggregate citizen data; novel mechanism |
| Program Consolidation | $1-1.5T | MEDIUM | Replacing SNAP, TANF, SSI, housing vouchers, etc. |
| **Total Revenue Potential** | **$3.45-6.2T** | | |

### Revenue Source Detail

**Automation Productivity Tax ($200-600B, MEDIUM confidence)**
Levied on firms that replace human labor with automated systems, calculated as a percentage
of the net savings (labor cost minus automation cost). Low end assumes modest adoption and
narrow application. High end assumes broad adoption across sectors. Novel tax with no direct
precedent; implementation design matters enormously.

**Value-Added Tax at 10-15% ($1.5-2.5T, HIGH confidence)**
The most reliable revenue source. The U.S. is the only OECD nation without a VAT. European
VATs at 15-25% generate 6-10% of GDP. A U.S. VAT at 10-15% on ~$17T in consumer spending
(with exemptions for food, medicine, and housing) yields $1.5-2.5T. This is well-established
policy with decades of international precedent.

**Land Value Tax at 2% ($500B-1T, MEDIUM confidence)**
Total U.S. land value estimates range from $25T to $50T depending on methodology. A 2%
annual tax yields $500B-1T. Medium confidence reflects valuation uncertainty and political
difficulty of implementation. Economically efficient: cannot be evaded, does not distort
production decisions.

**Carbon Fee at $50-150/ton ($200-400B, HIGH confidence)**
Based on current U.S. emissions of ~5 billion metric tons CO2-equivalent annually. At $50/ton:
$250B. At $150/ton: $750B, but emissions decline with higher prices, yielding a realistic
range of $200-400B in steady-state revenue. Revenue naturally declines over time as
decarbonization accelerates — this is a feature, not a bug.

**Data Dividend Tax ($50-200B, MEDIUM confidence)**
The digital advertising market alone is $250B+ annually, built entirely on harvested user
data. A Data Dividend Tax treats aggregate citizen data as a public resource and levies a
fee on its commercial exploitation. Wide range reflects novelty and design uncertainty.
Alaska's oil royalty provides the conceptual model.

**Program Consolidation ($1-1.5T, MEDIUM confidence)**
Federal spending on programs the Citizen's Royalty would replace or subsume: SNAP (~$120B),
TANF (~$30B), SSI (~$60B), housing assistance (~$55B), EITC (~$70B), plus portions of
Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and other transfer programs. Does not touch Social Security
retirement or Medicare. Medium confidence reflects political difficulty, not fiscal uncertainty.

## 4. Dynamic Effects (Second-Order)

Static models undercount the economic impact of a universal floor. These dynamic effects
are harder to quantify but directionally certain:

### Consumer Spending Multiplier
- Marginal propensity to consume for low-income households: 0.80-0.95
- Each dollar of Citizen's Royalty disbursed generates an estimated $1.50-2.00 in economic activity
- Annual GDP boost at full implementation: $1.5-3.0T
- This partially self-finances the program through increased tax revenue

### Healthcare Cost Reduction
- Poverty is the leading predictor of chronic disease, emergency room usage, and premature death
- Eliminating deep poverty could reduce Medicaid spending by 10-20%: $70-140B/year
- Reduced emergency room visits from uninsured/underinsured: $30-50B/year
- Mental health improvements reduce substance abuse treatment costs: $10-30B/year
- **Estimated healthcare savings: $110-220B/year**

### Criminal Justice Savings
- Strong causal link between poverty and incarceration (Western, 2006)
- U.S. spends $180B+/year on incarceration and policing
- Poverty reduction could reduce incarceration by 15-30% over a generation
- **Estimated savings: $27-54B/year** (conservative, long-term)

### Entrepreneurship and Small Business Formation
- #1 barrier to entrepreneurship: inability to survive without steady income
- Citizen's Royalty acts as universal startup capital and risk buffer
- Estimated increase in new business formation: 15-30%
- Long-term GDP contribution from new businesses: $200-500B/year

### Educational Attainment
- Children in households receiving guaranteed income show improved school performance
- Reduced financial stress improves cognitive function and decision-making
- Higher educational attainment increases lifetime earnings by $500K-1M per person
- Generational ROI is enormous but difficult to model precisely

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario A: Automation Is Slower Than Expected

**Assumption:** Displacement reaches only 50% of projected levels by 2040.

- Revenue from Automation Productivity Tax falls to $100-300B
- But VAT, LVT, and carbon fee are unaffected
- Program need is lower (less displacement = less urgency)
- Phase-in can slow accordingly
- **Model holds.** Revenue sources are diversified enough to absorb this.

### Scenario B: Automation Is Faster Than Expected

**Assumption:** Displacement reaches 150% of projected levels by 2035.

- Revenue from Automation Productivity Tax rises to $400-900B
- Urgency increases; phase-in must accelerate
- Political will likely increases with visible mass displacement
- GDP growth from automation is higher, expanding all tax bases
- **Model holds and strengthens.** Faster automation means more productivity, more revenue, and more political urgency.

### Scenario C: Behavioral Responses Are Larger Than Expected

**Assumption:** 10-15% of recipients reduce work effort significantly.

- Labor force participation drops by 5-8%
- GDP growth slows by 0.5-1.0% annually
- Tax revenue from income tax declines by $200-400B
- But consumer spending from Citizen's Royalty partially offsets
- **Model is stressed but holds** if other revenue sources perform at mid-range.

### Scenario D: Revenue Sources Underperform

**Assumption:** Every revenue source hits its LOW estimate simultaneously.

- Total revenue: $3.45T (low end of all ranges)
- Effective cost at full implementation: $3.74T
- **Gap: ~$300B** — manageable through modest adjustments (slightly higher VAT rate,
  broader LVT base, or slower phase-in)
- **Model bends but does not break.**

### Scenario E: Stress Test — What Breaks the Model?

The model breaks if:
1. Automation productivity gains fail to materialize (no GDP growth above baseline) AND
2. Revenue sources collectively underperform by 30%+ AND
3. Behavioral responses reduce labor participation by 15%+

This triple failure is theoretically possible but empirically unlikely. It would require
AI and robotics to displace workers without generating any productivity gains — a logical
contradiction.

## Methodology Notes

All projections in this appendix use the following conventions:

1. **Dollar values** are in 2024 constant dollars unless otherwise noted.
2. **Population figures** use Census Bureau medium-variant projections.
3. **GDP baselines** use Congressional Budget Office long-term estimates.
4. **Displacement estimates** synthesize McKinsey, Oxford Martin, Brookings, and BLS data.
5. **Revenue estimates** use Joint Committee on Taxation methodology where applicable.
6. **Confidence levels** are assigned based on evidence quality, not political feasibility.

This model is intentionally conservative on benefits and generous on costs. If reality
falls between our estimates, the program is more affordable than projected.

we can afford not to have it when automation arrives."*
