# Chapter 22
## The Geopolitics of Intelligence

---

In the summer of 1945, the United States detonated the first nuclear weapon and changed the structure of global power forever. Within four years, the Soviet Union had its own bomb. Within decades, nine nations possessed nuclear arsenals. The world spent the next half century managing the consequences of a technology that gave a handful of states the power to end civilization.

We are entering a second era like that one. But the technology is different, the dynamics are worse, and the timeline is compressed.

The race for artificial general intelligence is not a commercial competition. It is the most consequential geopolitical contest in human history. And unlike the nuclear arms race, which eventually reached a stable equilibrium through mutually assured destruction, the AGI race may have no stable equilibrium at all.

Because nuclear weapons are a technology of destruction. AGI is a technology of everything.

---

### Why AGI Is Not Like Nuclear Weapons

The comparison to nuclear weapons is natural but misleading. Both technologies represent civilization-level stakes. Both involve national security. Both create arms race dynamics. But the similarities end there.

Nuclear weapons do one thing: destroy. Their power is in their destructive capacity. They can be counted, tracked, limited by treaty. A bomb sitting in a silo does nothing except deter. The technology reached maturity decades ago. There has been no meaningful improvement in nuclear weapons capability since the hydrogen bomb.

AGI does everything. A true artificial general intelligence—a system that can perform any cognitive task a human can, and improve itself to do it better—is not a weapon. It is a universal tool. It is the best scientist, the best strategist, the best hacker, the best engineer, the best negotiator, the best spy, and the best weapons designer, all in one system, running at computational speed, twenty-four hours a day, improving itself every cycle.

Nuclear weapons confer the power to destroy. AGI confers the power to dominate.

The nation or entity that achieves AGI first does not just gain a military advantage. It gains advantage in every domain simultaneously—cyber, economic, scientific, diplomatic, military, and intelligence. We call this condition **Intelligence Primacy**: the strategic position of operating the most capable AI system in existence, which translates into supremacy across every arena of competition.

This is why the AGI race is more dangerous than the nuclear arms race. Nuclear weapons created a balance of terror. AGI may create an imbalance so total that the concept of balance becomes meaningless.

---

### The Breakout Threshold

Here is the concept that makes AGI geopolitics fundamentally different from every previous technology race: **recursive self-improvement**.

A nuclear weapon cannot design a better nuclear weapon. A stealth fighter cannot engineer a more advanced stealth fighter. Every previous military technology required human scientists and engineers to improve it, which meant improvement happened at human speed, on human timescales.

AGI can improve itself.

Once a system crosses the threshold of genuine general intelligence, it can turn that intelligence toward its own architecture. It can identify inefficiencies in its own code. It can design better training methods. It can optimize its own hardware utilization. And each improvement makes it better at making the next improvement.

This is the **Breakout Threshold**—the point at which a single AI system becomes sufficiently capable to recursively improve itself at a rate no human team, and no second-place AI, can match. Crossing this threshold does not create a lead. It creates an unbridgeable gap.

Imagine two nations racing to build AGI. Nation A arrives first, even by a margin of months. Nation A's system begins recursive self-improvement. Within weeks or months, that system has advanced far beyond the capabilities of Nation B's best AI. Nation B cannot catch up, because the target is accelerating away from them. The gap is not closing—it is widening, exponentially, with every cycle of self-improvement.

This is the winner-take-all dynamic. In most competitions, second place is a setback. In the AGI race, second place may be permanent subordination.

We do not know for certain that recursive self-improvement will work this way. There may be diminishing returns. There may be hard ceilings on intelligence that even self-improving systems cannot breach. We are honest about this uncertainty.

But the possibility alone is enough to drive the race. Because no rational nation can afford to assume the optimistic case and be wrong.

### The Current Race

The race is already underway. It is concentrated in two countries, with everyone else falling behind.

**The United States** is the current leader, home to the frontier AI labs building the most capable systems in the world:

- **OpenAI**: The most prominent name in AGI research, backed by Microsoft's billions, explicitly organized around the goal of building artificial general intelligence. Their stated mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity. Their business model requires getting there first.

- **Anthropic**: Founded by former OpenAI researchers specifically concerned about safety, Anthropic is building Claude with a "safety-first" approach. But safety-first does not mean safety-only. They are racing too, because they believe it is better for safety-conscious labs to reach the frontier than to cede it to less careful competitors.

- **Google DeepMind**: Perhaps the deepest well of AI research talent on Earth. DeepMind solved protein folding, created systems that mastered every game they touched, and is now building Gemini as their path to general intelligence. They have Google's infrastructure—the most compute on the planet.

- **xAI**: Elon Musk's entry into the race, explicitly pursuing "maximum truth-seeking AI." Musk has warned repeatedly that AI represents existential risk, and then poured billions into building it anyway. His logic: if someone is going to build it, better me than someone who does not share my concerns. This is the logic of arms races.

- **Meta**: Mark Zuckerberg's open-source strategy with LLaMA models. Open-sourcing frontier AI is either a gift to humanity or the most reckless act in technology history, depending on who you ask. Meta's approach democratizes capability but also puts powerful tools in the hands of anyone with enough compute to run them.

**China** is the second pole:

- **Baidu, Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent** are all building large language models and deploying them at massive scale across the Chinese internet.

- **The Chinese government** treats AI as a strategic national priority. The "New Generation AI Development Plan" laid out a roadmap to global AI leadership by 2030. State funding, data access through surveillance infrastructure, and a willingness to deploy without Western-style ethical constraints give Chinese AI a different character.

- **DeepSeek** emerged in 2025 with models that achieved near-frontier performance at a fraction of the training cost, demonstrating that compute efficiency could partially offset compute access limitations. This shocked Western assumptions about the durability of hardware export controls as a containment strategy.

**Everyone else** is falling behind. Europe has Mistral and scattered national efforts, but no lab at the frontier. The EU's regulatory approach—AI Act, GDPR—has made Europe a rule-maker but not a builder. The UK has strong research talent but limited compute infrastructure. Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Israel have pockets of excellence but no path to AGI on their own.

This means the future of artificial general intelligence will likely be determined by a two-player game between the United States and China. This is not a comforting thought.

### The Material Preconditions

AGI does not emerge from pure thought. It requires physical infrastructure on an unprecedented scale. The race for intelligence is, at its foundation, a race for resources.

**Compute Chips**: Training frontier AI models requires tens of thousands of specialized processors—GPUs and TPUs—running in concert for months. The world's most advanced AI chips are manufactured by a single company: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, TSMC. TSMC's fabrication plants in Taiwan produce the silicon that makes the AI race possible. This creates a chokepoint of extraordinary strategic significance.

Taiwan sits one hundred miles from mainland China. China claims Taiwan as sovereign territory. The geopolitical implications are obvious and terrifying. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would not just be a regional conflict. It would be a direct strike at the hardware foundation of Western AI supremacy.

The United States has recognized this vulnerability. TSMC is building fabrication plants in Arizona. Intel is expanding domestic chip manufacturing. But these plants take years to build and billions to equip. The dependency on Taiwan is not resolved—it is being slowly reduced.

**Energy**: AI training runs consume staggering amounts of electricity. A single frontier model training run can consume as much energy as a small city uses in a year. As models grow larger and training runs multiply, the energy requirements are scaling beyond what existing grids can provide.

This has triggered a scramble for power. Microsoft has signed deals to reactivate the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. Amazon is investing in nuclear power for its data centers. Google is pursuing geothermal and advanced nuclear. OpenAI's Sam Altman has personally invested in fusion energy through Helion.

The connection between AI and energy creates strange geopolitical alignments. Venezuelan heavy crude—the dirtiest oil on earth—becomes strategically relevant because it is energy, and energy is compute, and compute is intelligence. Nations sitting on massive energy reserves suddenly find themselves courted by AI powers who need their joules.

**Water**: Data centers generate enormous heat and require enormous cooling. Many use water-cooled systems that consume millions of gallons. In water-stressed regions—which includes much of the American Southwest, where data centers are proliferating—this creates competition between AI infrastructure and human needs.

**Rare Earth Minerals**: The electronics in AI chips require rare earth elements—neodymium, dysprosium, lanthanum, and others. China controls approximately 60% of global rare earth mining and 90% of processing capacity. This is another chokepoint, another dependency, another vulnerability.

Greenland's rare earth deposits have drawn American attention. The strategic interest in Greenland is not, as some have joked, about buying a large island. It is about securing supply chains for the materials that AI infrastructure requires. The same logic applies to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which supplies much of the world's cobalt, essential for batteries and electronics.

The AGI race is not just a contest of algorithms and talent. It is a contest for energy, silicon, water, and minerals. The nation that controls these inputs controls the pace and direction of intelligence development.

---

### Resource Nationalism

Watch what governments do, not what they say.

When the United States pressures allies to restrict chip exports to China, that is resource nationalism for the AI age. When China stockpiles rare earth minerals and threatens to restrict exports, that is resource nationalism. When nations compete for Greenland's mineral wealth, for Congo's cobalt, for Venezuelan energy reserves—that is resource nationalism.

The pattern is not new. Oil drove twentieth-century geopolitics. Whoever controlled the oil controlled the industrial economy. Wars were fought over it. Alliances were built around it. Nations that had it prospered; nations that did not were dependent.

In the twenty-first century, the critical resources have changed, but the pattern has not. The new oil is compute. The new strategic minerals are the ones that go into AI chips. The new energy race is not about fueling cars—it is about fueling data centers.

Governments understand this even when they do not say it publicly. The rhetoric is about national security, about jobs, about sovereignty. The reality is about securing the material foundation for intelligence dominance.

This is why export controls on advanced semiconductors to China are not really about trade policy. They are about the AGI race. The United States and its allies—Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea—have constructed a technology containment regime designed to deny China the most advanced chips. The goal is not to prevent China from having AI. The goal is to prevent China from having the *best* AI.

China understands this perfectly. The response has been a massive domestic semiconductor investment program, an effort to design around Western chip architectures, and aggressive acquisition of the raw materials needed for domestic production. DeepSeek's efficiency breakthroughs showed that compute constraints can be partially overcome through algorithmic innovation—a warning that export controls alone may not hold.

The new map of geopolitical power is being drawn along supply chains for silicon, energy, and rare minerals. The nations that secure these supply chains will shape the future. The nations that do not will be shaped by it.

### The Prisoner's Dilemma

Every major AI-developing nation faces the same dilemma:

*We want AI to be developed safely. We also cannot afford to be second.*

This is a classic prisoner's dilemma, and like all prisoner's dilemmas, it drives both players toward the worst collective outcome.

Consider the decision matrix:

If both the US and China slow down for safety, both benefit from reduced existential risk. This is the best collective outcome. But neither side can verify the other is actually slowing down. And if one side slows down while the other does not, the side that slowed down loses everything.

So both sides accelerate. Both invest more. Both cut corners where they can. Both deploy systems faster than careful testing would recommend. Safety research continues, but it is perpetually underfunded relative to capability research, because capability is what wins the race.

This is not a failure of individual decision-making. It is a structural trap. Every actor is making a rational choice given the incentives they face. The collective outcome is irrational—a world racing toward the most powerful technology ever created without adequate safety measures—but no individual actor can unilaterally change course without accepting unacceptable risk.

The dynamic is visible inside companies as well as between nations. Within each AI lab, safety teams compete for resources with capability teams. The researchers working on alignment—ensuring AI systems do what humans intend—are consistently outnumbered and out-resourced by the researchers pushing capabilities forward. Not because the companies do not care about safety. Because the competitive pressure to advance capabilities is relentless.

Sam Altman wants to build safe AGI. So does Dario Amodei. So does Demis Hassabis. They are sincere. But sincerity does not change incentive structures. When the race is existential, safety becomes the thing you promise to do *after* you win.

The problem is that "after you win" may be too late.

### Speed Kills

Here is the consequence of the prisoner's dilemma: safety is sacrificed for speed at every level.

**At the lab level**: Models are deployed before safety testing is complete. Red-teaming is abbreviated. Dangerous capabilities are discovered after release, not before. Anthropic and OpenAI have both published responsible scaling policies—frameworks that commit them to pausing deployment if certain capability thresholds are reached. These frameworks are genuine efforts. They are also voluntary, unenforceable, and subject to revision under competitive pressure.

**At the national level**: Regulations are drafted slowly and enforced weakly. The United States has issued executive orders on AI safety but passed no comprehensive legislation. China has AI regulations that serve CCP control objectives more than safety objectives. Europe has the AI Act, which is detailed and cautious—and which European AI companies argue is driving talent and investment to the US and China.

**At the international level**: There is no treaty, no monitoring regime, no verification protocol. The AI Safety Summits have produced communiques and commitments, but no binding agreements. The comparison to nuclear arms control is instructive: it took decades and multiple near-catastrophes before the US and USSR agreed to meaningful limits. We may not have decades.

The pattern is clear. Individual actors—labs, companies, nations—acknowledge the risks and express commitment to safety. The system as a whole moves faster than any of them can control. The gap between rhetoric and reality widens with each new model release.

This is what makes the AGI race an existential policy challenge. The danger is not that anyone *wants* unsafe AI. The danger is that the competitive structure makes unsafe AI the default outcome.

### The China Problem

Any honest discussion of AGI geopolitics must confront the China question directly.

China is developing AI aggressively, with massive state investment, access to data from 1.4 billion people, and a governance model that does not share Western concerns about privacy, consent, or individual rights. China's AI is built for a surveillance state—social credit scoring, facial recognition, predictive policing—and optimized for social control.

American AI labs use the China threat to justify their own speed. "If we slow down, China wins" is the most powerful argument against AI regulation in Washington. It is deployed relentlessly by those who want fewer constraints on AI development.

Is it true?

Partially. China is a serious competitor. Chinese AI labs are capable and well-resourced. China's government has declared AI a national strategic priority. The possibility of a Chinese-controlled superintelligence—optimized for CCP objectives, deployed without democratic accountability—is genuinely concerning.

But the China argument is also used cynically. It becomes a blank check for any AI lab to do anything without restraint. "We cannot afford safety" becomes the mantra, and China is the excuse. The logic is: better an unaligned American AI than an unaligned Chinese AI. As if those are the only two options.

The Human Standard rejects this false binary. The correct response to the China challenge is not to abandon safety. It is to integrate safety into the capability strategy so thoroughly that they become inseparable. A superintelligence that is uncontrollable is not an American asset—it is a planetary liability, regardless of which flag flies over the data center.

A rogue AGI does not care about nationality.

### The Timeline Is Compressed

Previous geopolitical competitions played out over decades. The nuclear arms race lasted fifty years. The Cold War lasted forty. The space race lasted ten.

The AGI race is measured in years. Perhaps fewer.

Major AI lab leaders have publicly stated that AGI may arrive before 2030. Some have suggested 2027 or 2028. Even accounting for the tendency of technologists to overstate the speed of their own breakthroughs, the trajectory of capability improvement supports a compressed timeline.

Consider the pace of advancement. In 2020, GPT-3 could write passable paragraphs. By 2023, GPT-4 could pass the bar exam. By 2025, models could engage in extended multi-step reasoning, write and execute code, and collaborate across complex tasks. The gap between each generation is shrinking while the capability jumps are growing.

This compression matters for geopolitics because diplomatic processes are slow. Treaties take years to negotiate. International institutions take decades to build. Verification protocols require sustained cooperation between rivals.

We do not have decades. We may not have years. The institutions we need for AGI governance do not exist, and the technology that demands them is arriving before they can be built.

This is the central challenge: the technology moves at the speed of silicon, and the governance moves at the speed of bureaucracy. Something has to give.

### The Human Standard Response

So what do we do? How does a democracy respond to an arms race that punishes caution and rewards recklessness?

The Human Standard proposes a strategy that refuses the false choice between safety and speed. We must do both—and we must build international frameworks while doing it.

**First: Win the race for capability.**

This is not optional. The United States and its democratic allies must maintain technological leadership in AI. An authoritarian regime achieving Intelligence Primacy would be catastrophic for human freedom everywhere. American AI leadership is not imperialism; it is the precondition for any governance framework that respects human rights.

This means sustained investment in AI research, compute infrastructure, talent pipelines, and energy systems. It means keeping TSMC-level manufacturing capability within the democratic alliance. It means ensuring that the material preconditions for frontier AI—chips, energy, minerals—are secured.

**Second: Build safety into the architecture, not as an afterthought.**

The Circuit Breaker protocol, detailed in our technical specifications, creates hardware-level safety mechanisms that cannot be circumvented through software. Physical kill switches. Air-gapped control systems. Cryptographic safety heartbeats that halt computation if the system behaves anomalously. These mechanisms impose minimal performance costs while providing genuine protection.

Safety that slows you down will be abandoned under competitive pressure. Safety that is built into the hardware—that is as fundamental as the power supply—survives the pressure. The goal is to make safe AI and fast AI the same thing.

**Third: Establish the Treaty of Compute.**

We need an international monitoring regime for AI development, modeled on the International Atomic Energy Agency's nuclear inspections.

The Treaty of Compute works because it targets something that cannot be hidden. Code is infinitely copyable and easily concealed. But the physical infrastructure required to train frontier AI models—tens of thousands of specialized chips, megawatts of power, massive cooling systems—has a physical footprint visible from space.

The treaty would include:

- **Supply chain tracking**: A global database of high-end AI chip shipments. Every advanced GPU accounted for, from fabrication to installation.

- **Energy monitoring**: Satellite surveillance of thermal signatures consistent with large-scale compute operations. You cannot hide a data center consuming hundreds of megawatts.

- **Compute thresholds**: Internationally agreed definitions of what constitutes frontier-scale training runs, with mandatory notification and monitoring above those thresholds.

This is not utopian. It is practical. The chips are manufactured by a handful of companies. The energy signatures are physically detectable. The supply chains are trackable. We do not need perfect enforcement—we need enough transparency to detect the most dangerous violations.

**Fourth: Share the Circuit Breaker.**

This is counterintuitive but essential. We should provide hardware-level safety technology—kill switches, monitoring systems, the Circuit Breaker protocol—to every nation developing AI, including rivals.

Why? Because a rogue AGI in China is a threat to the United States. A superintelligence that escapes the control of the Chinese Communist Party does not become America's friend. It becomes a planetary threat. Helping China install safety mechanisms on their AI systems is not charity. It is self-defense.

We share the brakes. We do not share the engine. Export controls on frontier chips and architectures continue. But the technology that keeps AI systems under human control should be as universal as possible. Every nation should have the ability to shut down its own AI if something goes wrong.

**Fifth: Defense-in-depth.**

No single safeguard is sufficient. The Human Standard's approach layers multiple independent protections:

- Technical alignment research to ensure AI systems pursue intended goals
- Compute governance to control the physical substrate
- Hardware Circuit Breakers to enable emergency shutdown
- Institutional oversight through the AI Policy Council and NAICO
- Democratic accountability through elected representatives
- International coordination through the Treaty of Compute

An AI system would need to simultaneously defeat all of these layers to escape human control. No layer is foolproof. Together, they create a security architecture robust enough to survive the competitive pressures of the race.

---

### What Winning Looks Like

Let us be clear about the goal. The Human Standard does not seek to stop AGI development. That is neither possible nor desirable. AGI, properly aligned and governed, could solve problems that have plagued humanity for millennia—disease, poverty, environmental destruction, the limits of human cognition.

The goal is to ensure that when AGI arrives, it arrives under democratic control, with safety mechanisms that work, within a governance framework that serves humanity.

Winning the AGI race means:

- The first AGI system operates under the Five Laws
- Hardware-level safety mechanisms are functional and tested
- International monitoring detects destabilizing concentrations of compute
- Democratic institutions retain meaningful oversight
- The benefits of superintelligent AI are broadly shared, not hoarded

Losing means:

- AGI is controlled by a single corporation with no democratic accountability
- AGI is controlled by an authoritarian regime that uses it for permanent social control
- AGI escapes human control entirely
- Safety mechanisms were never built because speed seemed more important

Every year of delay in building governance frameworks makes the bad outcomes more likely. Every month spent on safety architecture makes the good outcomes more achievable.

### The Stakes

It is worth pausing to state plainly what is at stake.

If the Breakout Threshold is real—if recursive self-improvement creates a permanent, unbridgeable gap—then the entity that crosses it first gains a form of power that has no historical precedent. Not the power of the strongest army or the largest economy. The power of the most intelligent agent on the planet, with the ability to become more intelligent without limit.

That entity could cure every disease. Or it could optimize the world for objectives that have nothing to do with human flourishing. It could solve climate change. Or it could render human decision-making irrelevant.

The outcome depends entirely on who builds it, what values it embodies, and whether the humans who created it retain any meaningful control.

This is not a problem for the next generation. It is a problem for this decade. The labs are racing. The chips are being fabricated. The energy is being secured. The training runs are getting larger.

The question is not whether AGI will arrive. The question is whether, when it does, humanity will have built the institutions, the safeguards, and the international agreements necessary to survive it.

The Human Standard exists to answer that question with something better than hope.
