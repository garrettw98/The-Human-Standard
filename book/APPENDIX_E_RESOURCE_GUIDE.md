# Appendix E: Resource Guide
## Organizations, Further Reading, Advocacy Opportunities

---

This appendix collects the most important books, studies, organizations, and action steps for anyone who wants to go deeper on the ideas in The Human Standard. It is not exhaustive. It is a starting point.

## 1. Key Books

### Automation and the Future of Work
- **Martin Ford**, *Rise of the Robots* (2015) -- The definitive account of how automation is displacing workers across every sector, not just manufacturing. Ford demonstrates that this time really is different.
- **Erik Brynjolfsson & Andrew McAfee**, *The Second Machine Age* (2014) -- How digital technologies are transforming the economy, creating both extraordinary abundance and unprecedented disruption. Essential for understanding the economics of automation.
- **Kai-Fu Lee**, *AI Superpowers* (2018) -- The US-China AI competition from someone who has worked at the highest levels of both ecosystems. A sobering look at how geopolitics shapes technology deployment.
- **Andrew Yang**, *The War on Normal People* (2018) -- The book that brought automation politics into the mainstream. Yang's analysis of trucking, retail, and call center displacement remains essential reading.

### AI Risk and Governance
- **Nick Bostrom**, *Superintelligence* (2014) -- The foundational text on existential risk from artificial intelligence. Dense but necessary reading for anyone concerned about where AI development is heading.
- **Stuart Russell**, *Human Compatible* (2019) -- A leading AI researcher's case for why we need to fundamentally rethink how we build AI systems. More accessible than Bostrom, more technically grounded than most popular treatments.
- **Kate Crawford**, *Atlas of AI* (2021) -- AI is not just software. Crawford documents the material costs -- the mines, the labor, the water, the energy -- behind the systems we are told are weightless and clean.

### Economics and Inequality
- **Thomas Piketty**, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* (2013) -- The data-driven case that inequality is not an accident but a feature of capitalism when returns on capital exceed economic growth. The r > g equation that changed the debate.
- **Daron Acemoglu & Simon Johnson**, *Power and Progress* (2023) -- Technology does not automatically benefit everyone. Throughout history, the gains from innovation have been captured by elites unless institutions force broad sharing. The most important economics book for understanding why The Human Standard is necessary.
- **Henry George**, *Progress and Poverty* (1879) -- Why does poverty persist alongside progress? George's answer -- that land monopoly captures the gains from growth -- remains as relevant today as when he wrote it. The intellectual foundation for Land Value Taxation.

### Universal Basic Income
- **Rutger Bregman**, *Utopia for Realists* (2017) -- The accessible, optimistic case for UBI, open borders, and shorter workweeks. A good entry point for people new to these ideas.
- **Andrew Yang**, *The War on Normal People* (2018) -- Listed again because it serves double duty: both automation analysis and UBI advocacy.

## 2. Key Reports and Studies

### Automation and Employment
- **McKinsey Global Institute**, *Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained* (2017) -- Up to 800 million workers globally could be displaced by automation by 2030. The report that forced the business world to take automation seriously.
- **Goldman Sachs**, *The Potentially Large Effects of AI on Economic Growth* (2023) -- Generative AI could affect 300 million jobs globally. Even Wall Street is sounding the alarm.
- **IMF**, *AI and the Future of Work* (2024) -- AI will affect 40% of jobs worldwide, with advanced economies most exposed. The international institution perspective.
- **Brookings Institution** -- Multiple studies on automation exposure by geography, demographics, and occupation. Essential for understanding who gets hit first.
- **OECD**, *Future of Work* projections -- Cross-country comparisons of automation risk and policy responses. Useful for benchmarking US policy against peer nations.

### Basic Income Experiments
- **OpenResearch**, *US Basic Income Study* (2024) -- The largest randomized controlled trial of unconditional cash in the US. Results were mixed: recipients worked slightly less and did not show significant health or education improvements. Honest assessment requires acknowledging these findings, though the study tested amounts far below the Citizen's Royalty level and for a limited duration.
- **Kangas et al.**, *Finland Basic Income Experiment* (2020) -- Two-year experiment showed improved well-being, trust, and modest employment gains. The gold standard of European UBI research.
- **West et al.**, *Stockton SEED Evaluation* (2021) -- $500/month to 125 residents. Recipients found full-time employment at higher rates than the control group. Small sample, big implications.
- **Jones & Marinescu**, *Alaska Permanent Fund Study* (2018) -- Alaska has distributed oil dividends since 1982 with no reduction in employment. The longest-running real-world evidence for unconditional cash.

## A Note on Sources

The Human Standard draws from research across the political spectrum. We cite libertarian economists, progressive policy institutes, centrist think tanks, and radical theorists. If an idea works, we do not care where it came from. Truth does not have a party affiliation.

We encourage readers to verify every claim in this book. Check our sources. Read the studies. Challenge the conclusions. The Human Standard is stronger when it is tested.

**The Human Standard** -- Not left. Not right. Forward.
