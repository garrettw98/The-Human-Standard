# NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

## THE PROBLEM

- $800+ billion annual defense budget (more than next 10 countries combined)
- Autonomous weapons race accelerating without governance
- Cyber vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure
- Climate change as threat multiplier
- Great power competition intensifying

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Strong defense. Smart spending. Human control of weapons.**

### Security Principles:

1. **Sufficient Strength**: Capable of defending nation and allies
2. **Smart Allocation**: Spend on what matters, cut waste
3. **Human Control**: Machines as tools, not decision-makers
4. **New Threats**: Address cyber, climate, pandemic risks

---

## KEY POLICIES

### Military Spending
- Maintain strong conventional deterrent
- Audit the Pentagon (never passed one)
- Cut redundant systems and cost overruns
- Invest in cyber and emerging threats

### Autonomous Weapons
**The Human Standard position**: Humans must control lethal decisions.
- Ban fully autonomous lethal weapons
- Require human-in-the-loop for all kill decisions
- International treaty leadership
- Defensive AI permitted with safeguards

### Cyber Security
- Critical infrastructure hardened
- Offensive capability maintained
- Public-private partnership
- Workforce development in cybersecurity

### New Security Threats
- Climate change (military recognizes as threat)
- Pandemic preparedness
- Economic resilience
- AI safety as national security issue

---

## AI AND DEFENSE

The Human Standard applies our AI principles to defense:

| Principle | Defense Application |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Do No Harm | Minimize civilian casualties |
| Human Agency | Humans control lethal force |
| Transparency | Congressional oversight |
| Serve All | Defense, not aggression |

**What this means:**
- AI for intelligence, logistics, defense systems: YES
- AI making autonomous kill decisions: NO
- AI in nuclear command: NEVER

---

## INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT

### Alliances
- Maintain NATO and Pacific alliances
- Fair burden-sharing among allies
- Collective security reduces costs

### Diplomacy
- Negotiate from strength
- International institutions serve US interests
- Reduce nuclear risk through arms control

### Trade
- Economic security is national security
- Supply chain resilience (critical goods)
- Technology competition with China

---

## THE ECONOMIC CASE

**Current spending is inefficient:**
- $2 trillion wasted in Afghanistan
- Weapons systems over budget, behind schedule
- Support costs exceed combat capability costs

**Smart defense is affordable:**
- Audit would find billions in waste
- Allies can share more burden
- Prevention cheaper than intervention
- Cyber defense cheaper than recovery

---

## COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"You want to weaken defense"**
No. We want effective defense. Waste weakens us. Smart spending strengthens us.

**"Banning autonomous weapons gives enemies advantage"**
International treaty applies to everyone. And we maintain human-controlled superiority.

**"Military spending creates jobs"**
Infrastructure spending creates more jobs per dollar. Defense should be for defense, not jobs program.

**"We cant trust arms control"**
Verification technology has improved. And controlled competition is safer than arms races.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

National security in the 21st century requires more than military might. It requires cyber resilience, economic strength, climate adaptation, and human control of the most powerful weapons. The Human Standard approach makes us safer and more prepared for actual threats.
