# CLIMATE & ENERGY
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

### THE PROBLEM
- Climate change threatens civilization as we know it
- Fossil fuel dependence creates geopolitical vulnerability
- Energy poverty holds back billions globally
- Current policies are too slow and too divisive

### THE SOLUTION
**Carbon Fee and Dividend + Energy Abundance**

Two strategies together:
1. Price carbon, return revenue to citizens
2. Invest massively in clean energy abundance

### CARBON FEE AND DIVIDEND

**How it works:**
- Fee on carbon at the source (well, mine, port)
- Starts at $30/ton, rises to $150+/ton
- 100% of revenue returned as monthly dividend
- Border adjustments for imports

**Who benefits:**
- Bottom 60% receive more in dividends than they pay in higher prices
- Creates market incentive for clean alternatives
- Revenue neutral - not a tax, a price correction

**Estimated dividend:**
- Year 1: ~$400/person/year
- Year 5: ~$920/person/year
- Year 10: ~$1,320/person/year

### ENERGY ABUNDANCE

**All of the above clean energy:**
- Solar and wind (cheapest new electricity)
- Nuclear (SMRs and advanced reactors)
- Geothermal (enhanced geothermal systems)
- Hydrogen (for industrial use, storage)
- Fusion research (long-term breakthrough)

**Grid modernization:**
- AI optimization of electricity flow
- Storage at scale (batteries, pumped hydro)
- Transmission buildout
- Demand response systems

### JUST TRANSITION

**For workers and communities:**
- Extended benefits for displaced fossil fuel workers
- Retraining and education support
- Community economic development
- Priority for clean energy jobs in affected regions

### WHO BENEFITS
- **Everyone** - Cleaner air, stable climate
- **Low/middle income** - Net positive from dividend
- **Workers** - Transition support, new jobs
- **Business** - Clear price signal, planning certainty

### COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"Carbon tax is regressive"**
Only if you keep the revenue. Dividend makes it progressive. Bottom 60% come out ahead.

**"We cannot afford it"**
We cannot afford not to. Climate damages cost far more than transition.

**"Nuclear is dangerous"**
Modern designs are inherently safe. Nuclear has lowest deaths per TWh of any energy source.

### THE BOTTOM LINE
Climate action and economic prosperity are not opposed. Clean energy abundance is cheaper, healthier, and more secure.
