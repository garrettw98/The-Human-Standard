# IMMIGRATION POLICY
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

## THE PROBLEM

- 11 million undocumented immigrants living in limbo
- Immigration courts backlogged 3+ million cases
- Arbitrary enforcement disrupts families and businesses
- Labor shortages in key industries
- System unchanged since 1986 despite economic transformation

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Orderly borders. Humane treatment. Economic integration.**

### Guiding Principles:

1. **Security**: Know who enters, enforce laws consistently
2. **Humanity**: Treat all people with dignity
3. **Economics**: Immigration policy should serve the economy
4. **Citizenship**: Clear path for those who contribute

---

## KEY POLICIES

### Border Security
- Modern technology (sensors, drones, AI monitoring)
- Adequate staffing and processing facilities
- Address root causes in sending countries
- Work visas to reduce illegal crossings

### Legal Immigration Reform
- Points-based system (skills, family, contribution)
- Increased visa numbers to meet labor demand
- Streamlined processing (months, not decades)
- Entrepreneur and investor pathways

### Undocumented Population
- Earned legalization for long-term residents
- Priority for DACA recipients
- Back taxes paid, background checks required
- Path to citizenship over 10-15 years

### Enforcement
- Interior enforcement focused on criminals
- Workplace verification (E-Verify mandatory)
- End detention as default (alternatives exist)
- Due process in immigration courts

## UBI AND IMMIGRATION

**UBI is for citizens and permanent residents.**

| Status | UBI Eligibility |
|--------|-----------------|
| Citizens | Full UBI |
| Permanent Residents (5+ years) | Full UBI |
| New Permanent Residents | Phased in over 5 years |
| Work Visa Holders | No UBI (working) |
| Undocumented | No UBI |

This removes the "welfare magnet" concern while maintaining human dignity.

## THE ECONOMIC CASE

**Immigrants are economic contributors:**
- Pay $405 billion in federal taxes annually
- Start businesses at higher rates than natives
- Fill critical labor shortages
- Social Security depends on working-age immigrants

**Regularization benefits everyone:**
- Workers can report abuse, improving all wages
- Tax compliance increases
- Economic contribution grows
- Enforcement costs decrease

---

## COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"They took our jobs"**
Immigrants mostly fill roles Americans dont want or where there are shortages. UBI ensures Americans can negotiate better.

**"Theyll just come for benefits"**
UBI only for citizens and long-term residents. Work visas require employment.

**"We cant handle more people"**
Population growth is slowing. Aging population needs workers. Smart immigration is economic necessity.

**"Amnesty rewards lawbreaking"**
Earned legalization includes penalties (back taxes, waiting period). Practical solution beats permanent underclass.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

Immigration policy should be orderly, humane, and economically rational. We can have secure borders AND treat people with dignity. We can enforce laws AND create workable legal pathways. The current dysfunction serves no one.
