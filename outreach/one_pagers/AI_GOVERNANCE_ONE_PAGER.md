# AI GOVERNANCE
## The Human Standard Policy Brief

---

### THE PROBLEM
- AI systems increasingly make decisions affecting your life
- Algorithms determine loans, jobs, healthcare, justice
- These systems are opaque, unaccountable, often biased
- Government AI can be corrupted just like human bureaucracy

### THE SOLUTION
**Open Source AI with Human Oversight**

All government AI systems must be:
- Fully transparent (code publicly available)
- Auditable (anyone can check for bias)
- Explainable (you can understand why a decision was made)
- Appealable (human review always available)

### THE FIVE LAWS

Every government AI must obey:

1. **Do No Harm** - Cannot cause physical harm or deprive necessities
2. **Maximize Flourishing** - Optimize for human wellbeing, not efficiency
3. **Preserve Agency** - Humans can always override
4. **Maintain Transparency** - All reasoning visible
5. **Serve All Equally** - No discrimination

### KEY POLICIES

**NAICO** - National AI Coordination Office
- Coordinates federal AI policy
- Sets standards for safety and fairness
- Investigates AI harms
- $500M annual budget

**Registration** - All significant AI systems registered
- Risk-based classification
- Bias auditing required
- Public registry of AI systems

**Appeals** - Right to human review
- Every AI decision can be appealed
- Explanation must be provided
- Human decides, not machine

### WHO BENEFITS
- **Citizens** get transparent, accountable government
- **Businesses** get clear rules and level playing field
- **Developers** get legitimacy and public trust
- **Democracy** gets preserved in the AI age

### COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"Open source is less secure"**
False. Linux runs most of the internet and is more secure than closed alternatives. Many eyes find bugs faster.

**"It will slow innovation"**
Applies only to government AI and high-risk applications. Most AI development unaffected.

**"AI decisions are too complex to explain"**
If you cannot explain it, you should not use it for consequential decisions.

### THE BOTTOM LINE
In a democracy, citizens have the right to know how they are governed. This includes algorithms.
