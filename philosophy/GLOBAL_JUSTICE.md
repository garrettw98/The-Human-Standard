# GLOBAL JUSTICE: The Human Standard and the Developing World
## Obligations Beyond Borders in the Automation Age
### By Zeno

---

## Preamble

The Human Standard claims universal philosophical principles but proposes US-centric policy. This is an honest tension, not a contradiction. We owe the reader a direct reckoning with what it means.

If human dignity is inherent and not conferred by citizenship, then the garment worker in Dhaka and the call center operator in Hyderabad possess the same moral worth as the software engineer in San Francisco. If flourishing is the proper aim of social arrangements, it cannot stop at the border. If justice demands that the benefits and burdens of automation be shared fairly, "fairly" cannot mean "among Americans only."

And yet: we are not a world government. We are a political movement operating within the constitutional framework of one nation. Our policy proposals require democratic legitimacy, institutional capacity, and political will that we can only mobilize domestically. We cannot tax on behalf of Bangladesh. We cannot legislate for Nigeria.

This document confronts the gap between universal principle and national implementation. It asks what wealthy automated nations owe to the Global South, proposes concrete mechanisms for meeting those obligations, and does so without retreating into vague aspiration or abandoning the framework's philosophical coherence.

**The Core Tension:** Our principles are universal. Our power is not. This document explains how we bridge that gap.

## PART I: THE PROBLEM WE CANNOT IGNORE

### 1.1 Automation's Uneven Geography

The automation age will not arrive uniformly. It will arrive first and hardest in the sectors upon which developing nations have built their economic strategies.

**The Sectors at Risk:**

| Sector | Countries Dependent | Workers at Risk | Automation Timeline |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Garment manufacturing | Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Ethiopia | 60+ million | 5-15 years |
| Call centers/BPO | India, Philippines, Kenya | 15+ million | 3-10 years |
| Electronics assembly | China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico | 30+ million | 5-15 years |
| Agricultural processing | Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia | 100+ million | 10-25 years |
| Data entry/processing | India, Philippines, Eastern Europe | 10+ million | 2-7 years |

These are not abstract numbers. These are the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people in nations that lack the institutional infrastructure, fiscal capacity, and safety nets to absorb rapid displacement.

**The Development Ladder Is Being Pulled Up:**

For two centuries, the path from poverty to prosperity followed a rough sequence: agriculture to manufacturing to services to knowledge work. Each rung of this ladder provided mass employment during the transition. Japan climbed it. South Korea climbed it. China climbed it.

Automation threatens to destroy each rung just as the next nation reaches for it. Bangladesh built an export economy on garments. Robotic sewing threatens that strategy before it can generate the wealth needed for the next stage. India built an outsourcing economy on English-speaking labor. Large language models threaten that strategy before India has completed its demographic transition.

The ladder is not merely harder to climb. It is being dismantled.

### 1.2 The Brain Drain Accelerator

Automation does not merely displace workers in developing nations. It accelerates the extraction of their most capable people.

**The Mechanism:**

1. AI raises the productivity premium on high-skill work
2. Wealthy nations compete for the global talent capable of building and managing AI systems
3. Developing nations lose their engineers, scientists, and doctors to visa programs designed to serve Silicon Valley and its equivalents
4. The nations that most need institutional capacity to manage automation lose the very people who could build that capacity

**The Numbers:**

- India trains over 1.5 million engineers annually; a significant fraction emigrate
- Sub-Saharan Africa loses an estimated $2 billion annually in training costs to brain drain in healthcare alone
- The AI talent pool is extraordinarily concentrated: the majority of top AI researchers work in the US, UK, or China regardless of where they were born

**The Perverse Cycle:**

Developing nations invest scarce resources in educating talented individuals. Those individuals, rationally, emigrate to where AI-era wages are highest. The developing nation is left with the training bill and without the talent. This is not a market failure in the narrow sense. It is the market working as designed, with devastating consequences for the nations that can least afford it.

### 1.3 Digital Colonialism and Data Extraction

The automation economy runs on data. And data is being extracted from the Global South in patterns that mirror colonial resource extraction.

**The Mechanisms:**

- Social media platforms collect behavioral data from billions of users in developing nations, process it in the US or Europe, and capture all the value
- AI training datasets incorporate the languages, images, cultural knowledge, and labor of the developing world without compensation
- "Data labeling" work, the invisible human labor behind AI systems, is outsourced to Kenya, India, and the Philippines at wages that would be illegal in the nations where the AI is sold
- Agricultural data from African farms trains precision agriculture AI that is then sold back to those same farmers at a premium

**The Pattern:**

Raw material flows out. Finished product flows back in. The value-added step occurs elsewhere. The profits accrue elsewhere. This is the colonial pattern reproduced in digital form, and the fact that it involves data rather than rubber or copper does not make it less extractive.

**The Scale:**

The data economy is projected to be worth trillions by 2030. The nations generating much of the raw data receive almost none of that value. The absence of data sovereignty frameworks in most developing nations means they have no legal mechanism to capture it, even if they wanted to.

### 1.4 The Permanent Subordination Risk

The deepest danger is not temporary disruption. It is permanent structural subordination.

**The Thesis:**

If a small number of wealthy, automated nations control the AI systems, the compute infrastructure, the training data pipelines, and the intellectual property frameworks of the automation economy, developing nations may find themselves in a condition from which there is no exit. Not because they are less capable or less deserving, but because the returns to AI scale exponentially and the gap between leaders and followers widens with each iteration.

**Historical Comparison:**

Previous technological revolutions eventually diffused. The steam engine spread. Electrification spread. The internet spread. But each of these technologies had a key property: they could be adopted incrementally, at relatively low cost, using locally available resources.

AI may be different. Training frontier models requires:
- Billions of dollars in compute hardware
- Massive energy infrastructure
- Vast proprietary datasets
- Deep pools of specialized talent
- Institutional knowledge that takes decades to build

If this combination of requirements means that only five or six nations can operate at the frontier, and if operating at the frontier confers decisive economic and military advantages, the result is not a temporary gap but a permanent hierarchy.

This is the scenario we must prevent.

## PART II: THE PHILOSOPHICAL STAKES

### 2.1 Cosmopolitan Justice: The Case for Universal Obligation

The strongest philosophical argument for global obligation comes from the cosmopolitan tradition.

**Peter Singer's Argument:**

If we can prevent suffering without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. Distance and nationality are morally irrelevant. The child drowning in a pond in front of you and the child starving on another continent make equal moral claims on you. The only difference is proximity, and proximity is not a moral category.

Applied to automation: if wealthy nations can share the benefits of automation with developing nations without sacrificing their own citizens' wellbeing, they are obligated to do so. The automation dividend is not like a zero-sum resource. It is, in principle, expandable. Sharing it does not require impoverishment.

**Thomas Pogge's Argument:**

Pogge goes further than Singer. The global poor are not merely unfortunate. They are actively harmed by an international institutional order that wealthy nations designed and maintain. Trade rules, intellectual property regimes, tax treaties, and financial regulations systematically advantage wealthy nations. The poor are not merely unlucky. They are wronged.

Applied to automation: the intellectual property frameworks that protect AI models, the trade rules that allow data extraction without compensation, the visa regimes that facilitate brain drain, these are not natural phenomena. They are institutional choices made by powerful nations. If those choices cause harm, the obligation is not merely charitable. It is compensatory.

**The Capabilities Approach (Sen and Nussbaum):**

Human flourishing requires a minimum set of capabilities: the ability to live a life of normal length, to have bodily health, to use imagination and thought, to have control over one's environment. These capabilities are not culturally specific. They are preconditions for any conception of a good life.

Applied to automation: if automation erodes the capability of hundreds of millions of people to participate in economic life, to feed themselves, to plan for the future, this is a capabilities failure of global scale. The Human Standard's commitment to flourishing (see [PHILOSOPHICAL_FOUNDATION.md](PHILOSOPHICAL_FOUNDATION.md)) cannot coherently stop at the US border.

### 2.2 Nationalist and Statist Objections

The cosmopolitan position faces serious objections. We take them seriously rather than dismissing them.

**The Sovereignty Objection:**

Nations are not merely administrative units. They are self-governing communities with the right to determine their own policies and priorities. International obligations imposed from outside violate this right. Developing nations are not children needing guidance. They are sovereign entities capable of making their own choices, including bad ones.

**The Institutional Capacity Objection:**

Even well-intentioned international aid often fails because it does not respect local institutional capacity. Imposing automation taxes on nations that cannot administer a basic income tax would be counterproductive. Development must be locally led and locally owned, or it breeds dependency rather than capability.

**The Democratic Legitimacy Objection:**

In a democracy, the government answers to its citizens. American policymakers are accountable to American voters, not to the citizens of Bangladesh. Diverting resources from domestic needs to international obligations without democratic mandate is paternalism dressed as morality.

**The Special Obligations Objection (David Miller):**

We have stronger obligations to those with whom we share a political community. This is not arbitrary. It reflects the reciprocal relationships, shared institutions, and mutual commitments that make political life possible. A parent who gives equal resources to their own children and to strangers is not more moral. They are neglecting a real obligation.

**Thomas Nagel's Position:**

Justice, in its full distributive sense, only applies within a state. Between states, we have humanitarian obligations (do not let people starve) but not justice obligations (ensure fair distribution). The global order lacks the coercive institutional structure that makes distributive justice both necessary and possible.

### 2.3 The Human Standard's Synthesis

We reject both pure cosmopolitanism and pure nationalism. Our position:

**The Principles Are Universal. The Implementation Is Pluralist.**

We affirm:
- Human dignity does not depend on nationality
- The obligation to prevent serious harm is not bounded by borders
- Institutional arrangements that systematically disadvantage the global poor are unjust
- The automation age creates new obligations because it creates new harms

We also affirm:
- Sovereignty is a real value, not merely a convenience
- Implementation must respect local institutional capacity
- Democratic legitimacy matters and cannot be bypassed
- Special obligations to fellow citizens are real and legitimate
- Top-down global governance is neither feasible nor desirable

**The Synthesis:**

Wealthy automated nations have genuine obligations to the Global South, obligations grounded in justice rather than charity. But these obligations are best met through mechanisms that respect sovereignty, build local capacity, and operate through voluntary cooperation rather than imposed mandate. The goal is not to govern the world from Washington. It is to ensure that the automation age does not become a new era of imperial subordination.

This is the principle of **subsidiarity**: decisions should be made at the most local level capable of addressing them effectively. Global problems require global coordination. But that coordination should empower rather than supplant national self-governance.

## PART III: CONCRETE MECHANISMS

### 3.1 Technology Transfer Obligations

**The Principle:**

Nations that benefit disproportionately from AI and automation have an obligation to share the enabling technologies, not the finished products sold at a premium, but the foundational capabilities that allow other nations to build their own AI ecosystems.

**The Mechanisms:**

1. **Open-Source AI as Global Public Good**
   - The Human Standard already commits to open-source government AI domestically (see [PHILOSOPHICAL_FOUNDATION.md](PHILOSOPHICAL_FOUNDATION.md))
   - Extend this commitment internationally: publicly funded AI research should be globally accessible
   - This is not charity. It is recognition that much of the training data came from global sources

2. **Capacity Building Programs**
   - Fund AI research centers in developing nations (not American outposts, but locally governed institutions)
   - Support university partnerships that build permanent local expertise
   - Target countries with existing institutional foundations: India, Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, Kenya
   - Budget: 1% of automation tax revenue dedicated to international technology transfer

3. **Intellectual Property Reform**
   - Current IP regimes allow wealthy nations to lock up foundational AI capabilities
   - Propose compulsory licensing for foundational AI models after a limited exclusivity period
   - Precedent: pharmaceutical compulsory licensing under TRIPS flexibilities
   - This is not abolishing IP. It is preventing permanent knowledge monopoly

4. **Compute Access Programs**
   - Access to computational resources is a prerequisite for AI development
   - Establish international compute-sharing agreements through allied cloud infrastructure
   - Subsidize compute access for developing-nation researchers
   - Connect to the "Treaty of Compute" framework (see Section 3.4)

### 3.2 The International Automation Dividend Pool

**The Concept:**

Just as the Citizen's Royalty shares automation's benefits with American citizens, an International Automation Dividend Pool (IADP) would share a fraction of those benefits globally.

**The Structure:**

| Component | Contribution | Governance |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Participating wealthy nations | 0.5-1% of automation tax revenue | International board with developing nation majority |
| Multinational tech companies | Voluntary contributions (with tax incentives) | Corporate advisory council |
| Data dividend | Percentage of value derived from developing-world data | Independent auditors |
| Carbon offset | Wealthy nations' AI energy use generates climate obligations | Linked to Paris framework |

**Disbursement Principles:**

- Funds go to national governments, not directly to individuals (respecting sovereignty)
- Tied to capacity-building outcomes, not to specific policy adoption (respecting pluralism)
- Independent monitoring to prevent corruption (respecting accountability)
- Phased reduction as recipient nations develop own automation tax capacity

**Scale:**

If the US automation tax generates $300-500 billion annually (per our projections), 1% represents $3-5 billion. Combined with contributions from the EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, and others, the pool could reach $10-15 billion annually. This is not transformative at global scale, but it is significant for targeted capacity building.

**Comparison:**

Global ODA (Official Development Assistance) was approximately $200 billion in 2023. The IADP would be a meaningful addition, with the crucial difference that it is framed as justice, not charity, and it is specifically targeted at the automation transition.

### 3.3 Fair Trade in the AI Era

**The Problem:**

Current trade frameworks were designed for physical goods. They are inadequate for an economy built on data flows, algorithmic services, and AI-generated outputs.

**Proposed Reforms:**

1. **Data Sovereignty Recognition**
   - Nations have the right to govern data generated within their borders
   - Trade agreements must include data governance provisions
   - "Data localization" is not protectionism; it is sovereignty
   - Developing nations need time and support to build data governance capacity

2. **Algorithmic Impact Assessments for Trade**
   - AI systems deployed in developing nations must undergo impact assessment
   - Assessments must be conducted with local participation
   - Precedent: environmental impact assessments for development projects

3. **Fair Data Compensation**
   - When AI systems are trained on data from developing nations, a compensation mechanism applies
   - Not per-datum pricing (impractical), but sector-level agreements
   - Example: AI agricultural advisory systems trained on African farming data pay into an agricultural development fund

4. **Anti-Dumping Provisions for AI Services**
   - Prevent wealthy nations from flooding developing markets with free or subsidized AI services that destroy local industry before it can develop
   - This is not protectionism. It is infant industry protection applied to the digital economy
   - Precedent: WTO anti-dumping framework, applied to digital goods

5. **Labor Standards in the AI Supply Chain**
   - Data labeling work must meet minimum wage and working condition standards
   - "AI sweatshops" are morally indistinguishable from textile sweatshops
   - Enforcement through procurement standards: US government AI systems must not rely on exploitative labor

### 3.4 The Treaty of Compute

**The Vision:**

Computational power is becoming as strategically significant as oil was in the 20th century. Access to compute determines who can train AI models, who can deploy them at scale, and who gets left behind. The "Treaty of Compute" proposes an international framework for governing this critical resource.

**Core Provisions:**

1. **Compute Access as Development Right**
   - Every nation has the right to access sufficient computational resources for domestic AI development
   - This does not mean equal access. It means minimum access sufficient for capability building
   - Mechanism: international compute-sharing consortium funded by wealthy nations

2. **Compute Concentration Limits**
   - No single nation or corporation should control a majority of global compute capacity
   - Monitoring and reporting requirements for large-scale compute deployments
   - Connected to the Sovereignty Crisis analysis in the broader framework

3. **Energy-Compute-Climate Nexus**
   - AI compute has massive energy requirements
   - Wealthy nations cannot solve this by offshoring compute to nations with weaker environmental regulation
   - The Compute Border Adjustment Mechanism (see [DEFENSE_FOREIGN_POLICY.md](../policy/DEFENSE_FOREIGN_POLICY.md)) provides the enforcement tool
   - Clean energy technology transfer is part of the compute equity equation

4. **Governance Structure**
   - Not a new UN agency (too slow, too politicized)
   - A treaty organization modeled on the International Atomic Energy Agency
   - Membership: all nations willing to accept transparency and monitoring provisions
   - Voting: weighted by population and contribution, not by GDP alone
   - Technical secretariat with real expertise, not political appointees

5. **Connection to International Coordination Strategy**
   - The Treaty of Compute builds on the coalition-building approach in [INTERNATIONAL_COORDINATION.md](../strategy/INTERNATIONAL_COORDINATION.md)
   - Phase 1: Bilateral compute-sharing with allies
   - Phase 2: Expand to developing-nation partners (India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria)
   - Phase 3: Formalize as multilateral treaty
   - Phase 4: Universal adoption as norm

### 3.5 Preventing Permanent Technological Subordination

**The Specific Danger:**

If developing nations become permanent consumers of AI systems designed, owned, and controlled by a handful of wealthy nations, the result is a new form of dependency more total than any previous colonial relationship. Colonial powers controlled land and resources. AI hegemony would control the decision-making infrastructure of entire economies.

**The Countermeasures:**

1. **Domestic AI Development Support**
   - Every nation should be able to develop AI systems tailored to its own needs, in its own languages, reflecting its own values
   - This requires: compute access, training data, talent, and institutional support
   - The mechanisms above (technology transfer, IADP, Treaty of Compute) serve this goal

2. **Interoperability Requirements**
   - AI systems sold internationally must use open standards and open interfaces
   - No vendor lock-in that prevents nations from switching providers
   - Data portability so that nations are not trapped in proprietary ecosystems

3. **Regulatory Sovereignty**
   - Trade agreements must not prevent developing nations from regulating AI deployment within their borders
   - "Regulatory coherence" provisions in trade deals must not become backdoor deregulation
   - Nations must retain the right to require algorithmic transparency, local data storage, and human oversight

4. **South-South Cooperation**
   - Not everything flows through the Global North
   - Support regional AI development hubs: East Africa, Southeast Asia, South America
   - South-South technology transfer and capacity building
   - Regional compute infrastructure to reduce dependence on US/European cloud providers

## PART IV: ADDRESSING THE OBJECTIONS

### 4.1 "We Can't Afford It"

**The Response:**

The mechanisms proposed here represent a small fraction of automation's economic gains. If automation increases US GDP by even 10% over 15 years (a conservative estimate), we are talking about trillions in new value. Devoting 1% of automation tax revenue to international obligations is not unaffordable. It is insurance against a destabilized world that would cost us far more.

Moreover, the alternative is worse: hundreds of millions of displaced workers in nations without safety nets means mass migration, political instability, failed states, and security threats. The cost of prevention is far lower than the cost of response.

### 4.2 "It's Not Our Responsibility"

**The Response:**

If our framework claims universal principles, those principles generate obligations. We cannot coherently argue that every human being has inherent dignity (see [PHILOSOPHICAL_FOUNDATION.md](PHILOSOPHICAL_FOUNDATION.md)) and then shrug when automation destroys the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people in nations that did nothing to cause the disruption.

Furthermore, as Pogge argues, the international institutional order that enables automation's benefits to concentrate in wealthy nations was not designed by the Global South. The IP regimes, trade rules, and financial architecture that make Silicon Valley possible were built by and for wealthy nations. When those systems cause harm, the obligation is not merely charitable.

We acknowledge the limits of this obligation (see Section 2.3). We are not proposing that America impoverish itself. We are proposing that America share a small fraction of historically unprecedented gains with those most harmed by the transition.

### 4.3 "Aid Doesn't Work"

**The Response:**

We agree that traditional development aid has a mixed record. That is why our proposals are not traditional aid:

- Technology transfer builds permanent local capability, not dependency
- The IADP is governed with developing-nation majority representation, not donor control
- Fair trade reforms change the structural rules, not just the resource flows
- The Treaty of Compute creates institutional infrastructure, not one-off projects
- All mechanisms respect sovereignty and subsidiarity

The critique of aid is a critique of how it has been done, not of whether wealthy nations have obligations. We propose doing it differently.

### 4.4 "This Will Be Exploited by Corrupt Governments"

**The Response:**

Corruption is a real concern, not a reason for inaction. Our proposals include:

- Independent monitoring and auditing
- Disbursement tied to outcomes, not inputs
- Transparency requirements as condition of participation
- Civil society participation in governance
- Phased disbursement with accountability checkpoints

We also note (per [EPISTEMIC_HUMILITY.md](EPISTEMIC_HUMILITY.md)) that we might be wrong about specific mechanisms. The commitment is to the obligation, not to any particular implementation. If the IADP proves ineffective, we try something else. If technology transfer is captured by elites, we redesign the delivery mechanism. The principle survives policy failure.

### 4.5 "This Undermines American Competitiveness"

**The Response:**

A world in which automation's benefits are hoarded by a handful of nations is not a world in which America thrives. It is a world of:
- Mass migration pressure on US borders
- Failed states that become security threats
- Markets that cannot afford American exports
- International resentment that fuels anti-American movements
- A moral authority deficit that undermines alliance-building

Sharing automation's benefits is not altruism. It is strategic self-interest. The Marshall Plan was not charity. It rebuilt markets, prevented Soviet expansion, and created the conditions for American prosperity. The automation transition requires a similar strategic generosity.

---

## PART V: CONNECTION TO THE BROADER FRAMEWORK

### 5.1 The Sovereignty Crisis

The broader Human Standard framework identifies a Sovereignty Crisis: the erosion of democratic self-governance by forces beyond any single nation's control. This crisis is even more acute in developing nations.

If a small number of AI companies, headquartered in a small number of wealthy nations, control the algorithmic systems that manage credit, healthcare, agriculture, and governance in developing nations, those nations' sovereignty is effectively hollow. They may retain formal independence while losing substantive control over their economic and political futures.

The proposals in this document are therefore not peripheral to the Sovereignty Crisis. They are central to it. Sovereignty for all, not just for the powerful, is what The Human Standard demands.

### 5.2 International Coordination Strategy

This document supplements [INTERNATIONAL_COORDINATION.md](../strategy/INTERNATIONAL_COORDINATION.md) and [INTERNATIONAL_STRATEGY.md](../policy/INTERNATIONAL_STRATEGY.md), which focus on coordination among wealthy democracies. Those documents address how to prevent a race to the bottom among nations with similar capabilities. This document addresses the obligations that wealthy automated nations have to those who lack the institutional capacity to implement their own automation governance.

The strategies are complementary:
- Build the coalition among wealthy democracies (INTERNATIONAL_COORDINATION.md)
- Ensure the coalition's policies do not harm developing nations (this document)
- Extend the coalition's benefits to developing nations as they build capacity (this document)
- Ultimately, build a global framework that includes all nations (Treaty of Compute)

### 5.3 Epistemic Humility

We acknowledge, consistent with [EPISTEMIC_HUMILITY.md](EPISTEMIC_HUMILITY.md), significant uncertainties:

| Claim | Confidence | Key Uncertainty |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Automation will displace developing-nation workers | High | Timeline and scale |
| Current international institutions are inadequate | High | Reform vs. replace |
| Technology transfer can build local capacity | Medium | Institutional preconditions |
| The IADP will be effective | Low-Medium | Governance and corruption |
| The Treaty of Compute is achievable | Low | Political will |
| Permanent subordination is the alternative | Medium | May underestimate developing-nation resilience |

We hold these proposals with conviction but not certainty. We are prepared to revise them based on evidence. What we are not prepared to do is ignore the problem.

---

## CONCLUSION

The Human Standard was born from a recognition that the automation age requires new thinking about governance, economics, and human purpose. That recognition does not stop at the American border.

We are a US-focused political movement because that is where we have democratic legitimacy and institutional leverage. We make no apology for this. But we refuse to pretend that our universal principles have only domestic implications.

The garment worker in Dhaka, the data labeler in Nairobi, the call center operator in Manila: they are not abstractions. They are people with the same inherent dignity that our entire framework is built to protect. If the automation age enriches us while impoverishing them, and if we do nothing, then our philosophy is not merely incomplete. It is hypocritical.

We choose a different path. Not global government. Not imperial charity. Not vague aspiration. But concrete mechanisms, grounded in justice, respecting sovereignty, building capacity, and refusing to accept a world in which the most transformative technology in human history becomes a tool of permanent subordination.

The Human Standard is not just an American project. It is a human one.
