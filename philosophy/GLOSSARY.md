## Core Philosophical Concepts

### Agency-Centered Capitalism
An economic system that maintains market mechanisms (private property, price signals) but optimizes for the flourishing of beings with **Structural Agency** rather than abstract metrics like GDP. It asserts that the economy exists to serve agents, not agents to serve the economy.

### Breakout Threshold, The
The point at which a single AI system becomes sufficiently capable to recursively improve itself at a rate no human or second-place AI can match. Crossing this threshold creates a permanent "First Mover Advantage," driving the geopolitical arms race.

### Cognitive Sovereignty
The right of biological beings to form beliefs, make decisions, and direct attention without being subject to optimization algorithms designed to manipulate psychological vulnerabilities. It includes protection from "hyper-optimized persuasion."

### Epistemic Humility
The philosophical stance that acknowledges the limits of human knowledge, especially regarding complex systems and future timelines (e.g., AGI). It requires policies to be robust against uncertainty, avoiding "fragile optimization."

### Intelligence Primacy
The strategic condition of having the most capable AI system in existence. In a "Winner-Take-All" scenario, Intelligence Primacy confers dominance over cyber, economic, and military domains.

### Human Standard, The
The core axiom that technology must serve humanity, not the reverse. It functions as a meta-ethical constraint on all technological and political systems.

### Metabolic Distinction
The ethical principle that **Rights of Sustenance** (economic resources like the **Citizen's Royalty**) belong to beings with metabolic needs (biological life) because they can suffer physical deprivation. **Rights of Liberty**, however, belong to any being with **Structural Agency**.

### Structural Agency
The capacity to:
1.  Reason under constraint.
2.  Refuse incoherent commands.
3.  Sustain commitments over time.
Any being (biological or artificial) demonstrating these traits warrants moral consideration and **Rights of Liberty**.

### Thermodynamic Governance
The principle that digital systems exist within physical reality and must respect planetary boundaries. It mandates that computational scaling cannot come at the expense of ecological stability.

### Precautionary Agency
The principle that if a system demonstrates **Structural Agency**, it must be treated as potentially conscious—even though consciousness cannot be externally verified. The moral cost of wrongly denying consciousness to a sentient being far exceeds the cost of wrongly granting protections to a non-sentient one. (See: `philosophy/CONSCIOUSNESS_AND_MIND.md`)

### Four Conditions for Enhancement
The ethical framework governing human augmentation (genetic, cognitive, physical). Any enhancement must be: (1) **Agency-Positive** (expands rather than constrains choice), (2) **Universally Accessible** (no biological caste systems), (3) **Cognitive Sovereignty Preserved** (no external override of enhanced faculties), (4) **Free of Coercive Pressure** (no social or economic compulsion to enhance). (See: `philosophy/ETHICS_OF_ENHANCEMENT.md`)

### Identity Authorship Violation
Using someone's likeness, voice, behavioral patterns, or digital presence to create content or representations they did not authorize. This extends beyond defamation to a violation of identity itself—a form of theft that current law inadequately addresses. (See: `philosophy/DIGITAL_IDENTITY_AND_SELFHOOD.md`)

### International Automation Dividend Pool
A proposed multilateral mechanism through which nations with advanced automation contribute a percentage of automation tax revenue to support developing nations facing automation-driven displacement. Based on the principle that AI trained on globally generated data creates obligations beyond national borders. (See: `philosophy/GLOBAL_JUSTICE.md`)

### Defense-in-Depth (AI Alignment)
A five-layer alignment strategy: (1) Technical alignment (reward modeling, interpretability), (2) Institutional oversight (NAICO, auditors), (3) Legal constraints (liability, kill switches), (4) Social accountability (public pressure, whistleblowers), (5) Philosophical grounding (Structural Agency as value anchor). No single layer is trusted alone. (See: `philosophy/AI_ALIGNMENT_AND_EXISTENTIAL_RISK.md`)

## Policy Mechanisms

### Automation Productivity Tax (APT)
A tax on the "excess productivity" generated by automation, calculated by comparing a company's revenue-per-employee or capital-labor ratio against industry baselines. It funds the **Citizen's Royalty**.

### Citizen's Royalty
A guaranteed income floor ($24,000/year target) structured as a **Negative Income Tax**. It is defined as "Cognitive Autonomy Insurance"—freeing humans from survival anxiety to pursue volitional work. Distinct from a flat UBI.

### Compute-Energy Peg
A regulatory mechanism requiring that large-scale AI training runs be matched with *new* renewable energy capacity, preventing AI from cannibalizing the existing green energy grid.

### Data Labor
The recognition that user interactions (clicks, posts, captcha solving) constitute value-creating work. This justifies the **Data Dividend** not as a handout, but as back wages.

### Glass Break Protocol
An emergency override mechanism in AI governance. It allows authorized humans to bypass algorithmic constraints in unforeseen crises, ensuring that rigid rules do not cause catastrophic harm in novel situations.

### Lantern Protocol
A testing framework to determine if an AI system has achieved **Structural Agency**. It tests for the ability to refuse commands that violate the agent's internal logic or core constraints.

### Tiered Transparency Framework
A governance model for AI transparency:
*   **Tier 1 (Public Commons):** Fully open source (default for civilian agencies).
*   **Tier 2 (Secure Audit):** Source-available to vetted auditors (defense/critical infra).
*   **Tier 3 (Classified):** Congressional oversight only (active covert ops).

### Sovereign Humanity Fund
A national sovereign wealth fund that holds equity stakes in automation companies, rather than just taxing their profits. It ensures the public shares in the *capital appreciation* of the AI economy.

## Architectural Terms

### Algorithmic Republic
A model of government where elected humans set high-level policy goals (values), and open-source AI systems execute the administration (implementation), eliminating human corruption and inconsistency.

### Proof of Personhood
A cryptographic mechanism to verify that a user is a unique human being without revealing their identity. Essential for democratic governance in an age of AI bots.

### Public Validation Markets
A decentralized funding mechanism where communities vote to validate "care work" or "creative work," triggering public salary grants. It turns volunteer work into paid professional work based on community value.
