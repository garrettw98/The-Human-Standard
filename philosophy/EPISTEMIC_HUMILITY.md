# WHAT WE MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT
## Epistemic Humility in the Human Standard
### By Zeno

---

## Preamble

The Human Standard is our best current thinking on governance for the automation age. But we do not claim certainty. We hold these ideas with conviction but also humility. This document explicitly acknowledges what we might be wrong about and how we would respond.

**The Core Principle**: Intellectual honesty requires acknowledging uncertainty. A framework that claims certainty about the future is not trustworthy.

## Part I: Major Uncertainties

### The Automation Timeline

**Our Assumption**: Significant economic transformation will occur within 10-20 years, requiring the systems we propose.

**We Might Be Wrong If**:
- AI capabilities plateau after current generation
- Robotics costs remain prohibitively high
- New job categories emerge faster than old ones disappear
- Transformation takes 30-50 years instead

**Our Response If Wrong**:
- The policies we propose remain beneficial (reduce poverty, improve governance) even without urgent automation
- We've designed trigger-based implementation precisely because we're uncertain
- If we're early, we've built systems we'll need later
- The cost of being early is much lower than being late

**How We'd Know**:
- AI benchmark progress stalls
- Productivity-employment gap stabilizes
- Job creation keeps pace with displacement
- Expert consensus shifts toward gradualism

### Bitcoin and Sound Money

**Our Assumption**: Bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencies will stabilize as sound money alternatives and provide protection against currency debasement.

**We Might Be Wrong If**:
- Volatility is structural and permanent
- Quantum computing breaks Bitcoin's cryptography
- Regulatory crackdown makes adoption infeasible
- Environmental concerns delegitimize proof-of-work
- Superior alternatives emerge

**Our Response If Wrong**:
- We've proposed sound money *principles*, not Bitcoin specifically
- Portfolio approach (60% Bitcoin, 20% gold, 20% other) diversifies risk
- The critique of fiat currency stands regardless of alternatives
- We remain open to better sound money technologies

**How We'd Know**:
- Volatility doesn't decrease with adoption (10+ more years of instability)
- Major security breaches in Bitcoin
- No mainstream adoption despite favorable policy
- Better alternatives demonstrate superiority

### Citizen's Royalty and Human Behavior

**Our Assumption**: Most people given unconditional income will continue to contribute meaningfully to society, whether through work, caregiving, creativity, or community.

**We Might Be Wrong If**:
- Large-scale Citizen's Royalty leads to widespread disengagement
- Meaning infrastructure fails to replace work's social functions
- Long-term effects differ from short-term pilot results
- Cultural differences make U.S. response different from pilot countries

**Our Response If Wrong**:
- We've proposed gradual implementation precisely for learning
- Longitudinal research is mandated
- Meaning infrastructure is a major investment, not afterthought
- Work remains rewarded above Citizen's Royalty level (incentives preserved)
- We're prepared to adjust based on evidence

**How We'd Know**:
- Pilot expansion shows concerning trends
- Mental health declines as Citizen's Royalty scales
- Community engagement drops
- Workforce participation drops more than expected

### AI Governance

**Our Assumption**: Open-source AI governance with tiered transparency will produce fair, effective, incorruptible administration.

**We Might Be Wrong If**:
- Open systems are easily gamed despite red-teaming
- AI bias proves harder to eliminate than we expect
- Transparency undermines effectiveness in more cases than anticipated
- Human oversight becomes rubber-stamp without real review

**Our Response If Wrong**:
- Tiered transparency allows adjustment
- We've preserved human appeal for all decisions
- Continuous monitoring will identify problems
- We can adjust transparency requirements based on evidence

**How We'd Know**:
- Systematic gaming of open systems
- Bias audits show persistent problems
- Outcomes no better than human bureaucracy
- Public trust in AI governance remains low

## Part II: Things We're More Confident About

### The Six Crises Are Real

We are highly confident that:
- Automation is accelerating (even if timeline uncertain)
- Trust in information is degrading (deepfakes, misinformation)
- Fiat currencies continue to lose purchasing power (96% since 1913)

These are empirically verifiable. The question is response, not reality.

### The Distribution Problem

We are highly confident that:
- Left unaddressed, automation gains will concentrate
- Market mechanisms alone will not distribute benefits broadly
- Some form of redistribution or stakeholder share is necessary

History of previous industrial revolutions, current inequality trends, and basic economics support this.

### Transparency Improves Governance

We are highly confident that:
- Transparency reduces corruption
- Auditable systems are more accountable
- Public scrutiny improves outcomes

Evidence across many domains supports this principle.

### Human Dignity Is Real

We are highly confident that:
- Human beings have inherent worth
- This worth does not depend on productivity
- Policy should respect this dignity

This is a value commitment, not an empirical claim. We hold it with conviction.

## Part III: Specific Policies and Uncertainty

| Policy | Confidence | Key Uncertainty |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Automation tax concept | High | Implementation details |
| Automation tax revenue projections | Low | Highly scenario-dependent |
| Citizen's Royalty concept | High | Scale and effects |
| Citizen's Royalty at $1,000/month | Medium | May need to be lower or higher |
| Open-source government AI | High | Scope of application |
| Tiered transparency | Medium | Tier boundary placement |
| Bitcoin integration | Medium | Which cryptocurrencies, how fast |
| Carbon tax | High | Rate and ramp |
| Land value tax | High | Political feasibility |
| National Service Corps | Medium | Scale and participation |

## Part IV: How We Respond to Being Wrong

### The Adaptation Commitment

We commit to:

1. **Monitor key indicators**: Track the metrics that would show we're wrong
2. **Revise based on evidence**: Change positions when evidence warrants
3. **Maintain core principles**: The Five Laws are permanent; policies are adaptable
4. **Transparent updates**: Publicly explain changes in our thinking
5. **No sunk cost fallacy**: Abandon failing approaches even after investment

### What Doesn't Change

Even if specific policies prove wrong:
- Human dignity remains foundational
- Technology should serve humanity
- Benefits should be broadly shared
- Transparency enables accountability
- Humans retain ultimate authority

These principles survive any specific policy failure.

### What Can Change

- Timeline expectations
- Specific tax rates and structures
- Citizen's Royalty amounts
- Technology preferences (Bitcoin vs. alternatives)
- Implementation sequences
- Organizational strategies

## Part V: Questions We Can't Answer

### We Don't Know

- Exactly when AGI will arrive (or if)
- How humans will find meaning without work at scale
- Whether international coordination will succeed
- How politics will respond to automation crisis
- Whether our movement will succeed

### Why That's Okay

Uncertainty is not a reason for inaction. We act under uncertainty constantly. The question is not "are we certain?" but "is action justified given uncertainty?"

Given:
- The potential severity of automation without response
- The low cost of preparation vs. cost of being unprepared
- The benefits of proposed policies even without automation crisis

Action is justified despite uncertainty.

## Part VI: The Honest Posture

### What We Claim

- We have studied these issues carefully
- We have developed what we believe are good responses
- We hold these views with conviction
- We are prepared to act on them

### What We Don't Claim

- Certainty about the future
- Perfect solutions
- Final answers
- Exclusive truth

### The Commitment

We ask others to engage with our framework critically. Tell us what's wrong. Challenge our assumptions. Propose alternatives.

We will:
- Listen seriously
- Respond substantively
- Change when warranted
- Explain when we don't change

---

## Part VII: An Invitation to Critics

### We Welcome Critique Of

- Our timeline assumptions
- Our economic projections
- Our political strategy
- Our specific policy designs
- Our philosophical foundations

### Good Faith Engagement

We distinguish:
- **Good faith critique**: "Here's why your automation tax won't work..."
- **Bad faith dismissal**: "This is socialism/utopianism/etc."

We engage with the former. We note but don't dwell on the latter.

### How to Critique Effectively

1. Identify the specific claim you're challenging
2. Explain why you think it's wrong
3. Propose what you think is correct
4. Suggest how we might test the disagreement

We take this seriously. Our best critics will improve our framework.

## Conclusion

The Human Standard is a framework held with conviction and humility.

**Conviction**: We believe these ideas are right, important, and urgent. We're prepared to act on them, advocate for them, and build a movement around them.

**Humility**: We know we might be wrong about specific predictions, policies, and approaches. We commit to learning, adapting, and improving.

This is not contradiction. It is intellectual honesty.

The worst response to uncertainty is paralysis. The second-worst is false certainty. We aim for a third way: act with conviction, monitor for error, adapt based on evidence.

This is what it means to build a political philosophy responsibly.

*"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken."*

—Oliver Cromwell (in one of his better moments)

*"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."*

—F. Scott Fitzgerald

We hold these ideas. We also hold the possibility that they're wrong. This is not weakness. It is the only intellectually honest posture.
