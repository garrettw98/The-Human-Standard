# THE HUMAN STANDARD
## A Post-Biological Political Philosophy for the Automation Age
### By Zeno

---

**Technology should serve agency. Not the other way around.**

---

## Core Innovations

**A post-biological framework bridging digital philosophy and physical reality.**

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Humanity (zk-PoH)**: Privacy-preserving eligibility verification. No central biometric database.
- **Thermodynamic Governance**: Compute-Energy Peg ties large AI training to NEW renewable capacity.
- **Data Unions & Collective Disconnect**: Right to organize Data Unions. Legal authority for "Data Strikes."
- **Ecological Stability**: Do No Harm expanded to planetary scale.
- **Cognitive Sovereignty**: Protects humans from AI manipulation, hyper-optimized persuasion, and "human downgrading"
- **Bonded Agency Protocol**: Prevents AI personhood from becoming corporate liability shield
- **Metabolic Distinction**: Citizen's Royalty reserved for biological life (AI can earn, not receive)
- **Vocational Economy**: Shifts from "freedom from work" to "freedom to work" (face-to-face economy)

## What Is This?

**The Human Standard** is a foundational text and comprehensive political philosophy for the age of AI and automation. It is designed to serve as the intellectual bedrock for future movements, policy-making, and societal evolution.

This repository contains:
- A complete **26-chapter book** exploring the philosophical and practical implications of the automation age.
- **Manifesto and Constitution**: The core values and legal principles.
- **10 Comprehensive Policy Frameworks**: Detailed blueprints for economic, social, and technological governance.

## The Three Crises

### 1. The Automation Crisis
AI and robotics will transform the economy within years, not decades. Current institutions are unprepared for the decoupling of labor from value creation.

### 2. The Trust Crisis
Deepfakes make truth unverifiable. Corruption pervades human institutions. The collapse of shared reality threatens democratic governance.

### 3. The Monetary Crisis
Fiat currency has lost 96% of purchasing power since 1913. Central banks serve elites, not citizens. The store of value is broken.

## The Solution: The Human Standard

**Agency-Centered Capitalism** governed by **Tiered AI Transparency + Lantern Protocol** funded by **Purchasing Power Stability**

| Pillar | Principle | Key Policy |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Economic | Automation benefits all agents | Citizen's Royalty (NIT) as Cognitive Autonomy Insurance + Sovereign Humanity Fund |
| Governance | AI administers, agents decide | Tiered Transparency Framework + Lantern Protocol |
| Monetary | Money agents control | Diversified Strategic Reserve |
| Truth | Verification for all | Blockchain Infrastructure |
| Agency | Rights from capacity, not biology | Structural Agency + Stewardship Model |
