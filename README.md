# THE HUMAN STANDARD
## A Post-Biological Political Philosophy for the Automation Age
### By Zeno

---

**Technology should serve agency. Not the other way around.**

---

## Core Innovations

**A post-biological framework bridging digital philosophy and physical reality.**

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Humanity (zk-PoH)**: Privacy-preserving eligibility verification. No central biometric database.
- **Thermodynamic Governance**: Compute-Energy Peg ties large AI training to NEW renewable capacity.
- **Data Unions & Collective Disconnect**: Right to organize Data Unions. Legal authority for "Data Strikes."
- **Ecological Stability**: Do No Harm expanded to planetary scale.
- **Cognitive Sovereignty**: Protects humans from AI manipulation, hyper-optimized persuasion, and "human downgrading"
- **Bonded Agency Protocol**: Prevents AI personhood from becoming corporate liability shield
- **Metabolic Distinction**: Citizen's Royalty reserved for biological life (AI can earn, not receive)
- **Vocational Economy**: Shifts from "freedom from work" to "freedom to work" (face-to-face economy)

## The Six Crises

1.  **The Automation Crisis**: AI will displace human labor at a scale and speed that makes traditional retraining impossible.
2.  **The Trust Crisis**: Deepfakes and synthetic media are destroying the shared reality necessary for democracy.
3.  **The Monetary Crisis**: Continuous debasement of fiat currency steals wealth from workers and savers.
4.  **The Commons Crisis**: Unpaid data labor powers the AI economy while platforms capture all the value.
5.  **The Sovereignty Crisis**: The race for superintelligence threatens to bypass human control entirely.
6.  **The Existential Crisis**: Ideologies of "post-humanism" seek to discard humanity as an obsolete bottleneck.
