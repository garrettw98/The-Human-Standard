# THE AUTOMATION DIVIDEND
## Everyone Gets a Share

---

### The Problem

AI and robots will do most jobs better and cheaper than humans. This isn't decades away—it's happening now. Without intervention, this creates two classes: those who own the machines, and those who got replaced by them.

### The Solution

**The Automation Dividend** ensures everyone benefits from technological progress. We tax machine productivity, invest the revenue in a national wealth fund, and pay dividends to every citizen.

### How It Works

- **Automation Tax**: When machines replace human work, companies contribute to the national wealth fund
- **Sovereign Wealth Fund**: Revenue is invested (like Alaska's Permanent Fund or Norway's oil fund)
- **Citizen Dividend**: Every adult receives regular payments from the fund's returns

### Why This Is Different

- **Not welfare**—it's your share of what the machines produce
- **Not anti-technology**—we embrace automation, we just share the gains
- **Not left or right**—it's about ensuring everyone has a stake in the future

### The Numbers

| Phase | Timeline | Monthly Dividend |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Foundation | Years 1-5 | $200-300 |
| Growth | Years 5-10 | $400-600 |
| Maturity | Years 10-20 | $800-1,200+ |

### The Core Principle

> *You built this economy. You trained the AI on your data. You deserve a stake in the automated future.*
