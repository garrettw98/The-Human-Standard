# ORGANIZATIONAL CHARTER
## The Automation Dividend Institute
### Draft Founding Document

---

## Preamble

The Human Standard is a set of ideas. Ideas require organization to have impact. This charter establishes the organizational structure to advance the Human Standard framework into political reality.

**The Principle**: The ideas belong to everyone. The organization exists to serve the ideas, not the reverse.

---

## Part I: Identity

### Name

**The Automation Dividend Institute** (ADI)

Alternatively, for political advocacy arm: **Automation Dividend Coalition** (ADC)

### Mission

To ensure that the benefits of automation and artificial intelligence are shared broadly with all people through research, education, and advocacy for policies including universal basic income, automation taxation, sound money, and accountable AI governance.

### Vision

A future where technological progress benefits everyone—where automation frees humans from drudgery rather than displacing them into poverty, and where the gains from machine productivity fund universal economic security.

### Values

1. **Human Dignity**: Every person has inherent worth
2. **Transparency**: We practice what we preach—our operations are open
3. **Intellectual Honesty**: We acknowledge uncertainty and adapt to evidence
4. **Democratic Commitment**: We serve the people, not funders or leaders
5. **Effectiveness**: We measure ourselves by real-world impact
6. **Inclusion**: This movement is for everyone, especially those most affected

## Part II: Legal Structure

### Two-Organization Model

### Why Two Organizations

- (c)(3) enables tax-deductible donations, grants, research funding

- Combined: Full spectrum from research to electoral politics

### Relationship

- Separate boards, separate finances
