# POLITICAL SPEC: Democratic Sortition
## Patching the "Election Vulnerability" in the AI Age
### The Human Standard (Version 0.9.1)

---

## Executive Summary

**The Threat:** Elections are the primary attack vector for AI-driven manipulation.
*   **Hyper-Persuasion:** AI can micro-target every voter with a personalized lie.
*   **Deepfakes:** Reality is malleable.
*   **Lobbying:** AI can generate infinite synthetic "grassroots" pressure.

As long as we rely on *Mass Voting* for complex policy, Democracy is hackable.

**The Solution:** **Sortition (Democracy by Lottery).**
We replace (or augment) elected chambers with **Citizens' Assemblies**—randomly selected panels of normal people who deliberate in a secure, informed environment.

## Part I: The Mechanics of the Citizens' Assembly

### 1.1 Selection (The "Jury Duty" Model)
*   **Pool:** Every adult citizen.
*   **Selection:** Cryptographically secure random lottery, stratified to ensure demographic representation (Age, Race, Income, Geography).
*   **Service:** 2-year term. Full-time job.
*   **Pay:** High (e.g., $150k/year) to ensure no bribery risk and that anyone can afford to serve.

### 1.2 The "Cognitive Clean Room"
Elected officials spend 50% of their time fundraising and 40% consuming media.
The Assembly spends 100% of their time **Learning**.
*   **Input:** They do not watch Fox/MSNBC. They hear testimony from experts (pro/con), stakeholders, and receive "Fact Briefs" verified by the AI Policy Council.
*   **Process:** Deliberation, not Debate. Facilitated to find consensus, not conflict.

### 1.3 The Role of AI
*   **The Summarizer:** AI digests 10,000 pages of technical reports into readable briefs.
*   **The Simulator:** The Assembly proposes a policy -> AI simulates the economic outcome -> Assembly refines.

## Part II: The Bicameral "Sortition" Legislature

We propose a constitutional amendment to restructure the Legislative Branch:

**1. The House of Representatives (Elected):**
*   **Role:** **Values & Signaling.**
*   Still elected. They propose bills and "signal" the public mood.
*   *Vulnerability:* High (Hackable).

**2. The Senate (Sorted):**
*   **Role:** **Review & Refinement.**
*   Replaced by a Citizens' Assembly (1,000 people).
*   **Power:** They vote "Yes/No" on House bills. They can amend. They can veto.
*   **Security:** Because they are selected *randomly*, you cannot bribe them in advance. Because they are sequestered in the "Clean Room," you cannot manipulate them with deepfakes.

## Part III: Defense Against Oligarchy

Sortition is the only defense against:
1.  **Party Capture:** Random people have no party loyalty.
2.  **Lobbyist Capture:** You can't promise a "future job" to a random nurse or mechanic as easily as to a career politician.
3.  **AI Capture:** You can't micro-target them because their identity is concealed until they are sworn in.

## Conclusion

Elections were a proxy for "The Will of the People" when we couldn't fit everyone in a room. Now, they are a proxy for "The Will of the Algorithm."
Sortition restores the "Human Standard" to politics: **Actual humans, talking to each other, making decisions based on evidence, not vibes.**
