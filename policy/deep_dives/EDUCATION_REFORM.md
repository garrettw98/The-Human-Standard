# STRATEGIC SPEC: The Socratic Turn
## Education for the Age of Volitional Cognition
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

**The Crisis:** The current education system was designed for the Industrial Age to produce "Processors" (workers who follow instructions and retrieve facts). In the AI Age, "Processing" is free. If we continue to train humans to be Processors, we are training them to be obsolete.

**The Shift:** We must pivot from **"Answer Retrieval"** to **"Question Formulation."**
The human comparative advantage is not *Intelligence* (speed/memory); it is **Volition** (deciding what is worth doing).

## Part I: The "Anti-Atrophy" Curriculum

Just as we exercise muscles to prevent atrophy in a sedentary world, we must exercise *Cognition* in an automated world.

### 1.1 The "Calculator Rule"
*   **Principle:** You are not allowed to use the Tool until you have mastered the Skill.
*   **Application:**
    *   **Writing:** Students must write essays by hand/offline to develop *structural thinking* before using LLMs to expand/polish.
    *   **Coding:** Students must learn logic and syntax manually before using AI Code Assistants.
*   **Why:** If you cannot think without the AI, you are not a "Pilot" of the system; you are a "Passenger."

### 1.2 The New Core Subjects
The "3 Rs" (Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic) are replaced by the **"3 Cs"**:

1.  **Critical Evaluation (Epistemology):**
    *   How to verify truth.
    *   How to identify logical fallacies.
    *   How to audit an AI's output for bias/hallucination.
2.  **Complex Systems (Systems Thinking):**
    *   Understanding second-order effects.
    *   Game Theory and incentives.
    *   Ecology and feedback loops.
3.  **Creative Synthesis (Volition):**
    *   Asking the "Right Question."
    *   Defining value and meaning.
    *   Ethical reasoning (The "Lantern Protocol" applied to self).

## Part II: The AI Tutor (The "Diamond Young" Model)

We do not ban AI; we optimize it for *growth* rather than *relief*.

**The "Socratic" Mode:**
*   Current AI: "What is the capital of France?" -> "Paris." (Cognitive Load: Zero).
*   **Socratic AI:** "What is the capital of France?" -> "What implies the existence of a 'capital'? How would you determine where the seat of power lies?"
*   **Goal:** The AI Tutor acts as a personal sparring partner, constantly pushing the student into the "Zone of Proximal Development." It refuses to give answers; it only gives clues.

## Part III: Lifelong Learning Accounts (LLAs)

Education is no longer "K-12 + College." It is continuous.
*   **Mechanism:** Part of the Automation Dividend (see `ECONOMIC_POLICY.md`) is deposited into a restricted **LLA**.
*   **Use:** Can only be spent on accredited *Human-to-Human* training, Workshops, Masterclasses, or "Sabbatical Projects."
*   **Goal:** Funding the "Mastery" drive defined in `MEANING.md`.

## Conclusion

We are not raising workers. We are raising **Architects**. The machine builds the building; the human designs it, critiques it, and decides if it should be built at all.
