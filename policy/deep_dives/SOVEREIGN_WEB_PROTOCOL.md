# TECHNICAL SPEC: The Sovereign Web Protocol (SWP)
## Rebuilding Trust at the Packet Level
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

The current web (HTTP/DNS) was designed for a high-trust environment where "Identity" was irrelevant. In the age of AI, this is a fatal flaw. We cannot distinguish a human from a bot swarm, nor a real video from a deepfake.

We propose **SWP (Sovereign Web Protocol)**: a new application-layer protocol (running parallel to HTTP) designed for **Verification, Provenance, and Reputation.**

*   **URI Scheme:** `swp://`
*   **Core Philosophy:** "Trust nothing. Verify signatures."

## Part I: The Three Pillars of SWP

### 1. Identity (Proof of Personhood)
*   **The Problem:** Sybil Attacks (one attacker, million bots).
*   **The SWP Header:** Every request includes an `X-SWP-Identity` signature.
    *   **Human Agents:** Signed by a "Personhood Wallet" (containing a ZK-Proof of unique humanity).
    *   **AI Agents:** Signed by a "Bonded Steward Key" (traceable to a liable entity).
    *   **Anonymous:** Allowed, but routed to "Low-Priority / Untrusted" queues by default.
*   **Privacy:** The ZK-Proof confirms "I am a unique human" *without* revealing "I am John Doe."

### 2. Provenance (Content Authenticity)
*   **The Problem:** Deepfakes and theft of IP.
*   **The C2PA Standard:** Baked into the protocol.
    *   Images/Text served over SWP *must* carry a cryptographic chain of custody.
    *   *Browser UX:* A "Blue Check" next to a video means "Signed by Reuters Camera #451, unaltered." A "Robot Icon" means "Generated by Midjourney." No icon means "Unverified/Unknown."
*   **The "Right to Reality":** Users can configure their PCG (Cognitive Guardian) to "Blur Unverified Content."

### 3. Reputation (The Routing Layer)
*   **The Problem:** DDoS and Spam.
*   **The Solution:** Economic/Reputational Metering.
    *   Sending a request requires a micro-stake (Reputation Token or Compute Proof).
    *   If the request is spam/malicious, the stake is slashed.
    *   **Result:** Spamming becomes prohibitively expensive.

## Part II: Implementation Strategy

### 2.1 The "Dual-Stack" Transition
We do not kill the old web. SWP runs alongside HTTP.
*   **Phase 1:** Browser Extensions handle `swp://` links.
*   **Phase 2:** Native Browser Support (Firefox/Chrome integration).
*   **Phase 3:** "SWP-Only" Zones. Banks, Voting Portals, and Social Media login require SWP connections for write-access.

### 2.2 The Sovereign Domain Name System (SDNS)
*   Replaces ICANN with a decentralized ledger.
*   Domains are NFTs/Assets owned by the registrant, not leased.
*   **The "Verified" TLDs:** `.human`, `.agent`, `.gov.swp`.
    *   Only verified humans can register `.human`.
    *   Only Bonded AI can register `.agent`.

## Part III: The "Human-Only" Spaces

SWP enables the creation of **Digital Parks**: spaces on the internet guaranteed to be bot-free.
*   **Handshake:** Server challenges Client -> Client provides ZK-Proof of Humanity -> Server opens connection.
*   **Use Case:** Dating apps, Town Hall debates, Mental Health support groups.
*   **Value:** These spaces become the "Premium" internet, where genuine connection is possible.

## Conclusion

SWP moves the internet from a **"Default Open"** posture (where bad actors overwhelm good ones) to a **"Default Verified"** posture (where trust is the baseline). It is the digital infrastructure required to enforce the Human Standard.
