# SCENARIO ANALYSIS
## Designing for Uncertainty in the Automation Timeline
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

We don't know exactly when or how fast automation will transform the economy. Predictions have historically been unreliable—both too optimistic and too pessimistic. Rather than betting on a single timeline, this document presents three scenarios and designs policies that remain robust across all of them.

**The Core Insight**: The cost of building systems too early is manageable. The cost of building them too late is catastrophic. This asymmetry justifies preparation even under uncertainty.

---

## Part I: The Three Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Gradual Transformation (30-50 Years)

**Assumptions**:
- AI capabilities plateau after current generation
- Robotics costs remain high, limiting physical automation
- New job categories emerge faster than old ones disappear
- Job displacement averages 1-2% per year (historically normal)

**Key Indicators**:
- AI error rates remain too high for unsupervised deployment in most domains
- Humanoid robot costs stay above $50,000 per unit
- Tech unemployment stays below historical average
- Productivity-wage gap narrows rather than widens

**What This World Looks Like**:
- Gradual shift, similar to previous industrial transitions
- Labor markets adapt through normal mechanisms
- Some displacement, but manageable with existing safety nets plus modest reforms
- The "future of work" becomes evolution, not revolution

**Policy Implications**:
- Full Automation Dividend framework remains beneficial but less urgent
- Citizen's Royalty serves poverty reduction role, not displacement response
- Sound money and truth infrastructure valuable regardless of automation
- More time for international coordination

### Scenario 2: Accelerated Transformation (10-20 Years)

**Assumptions**:
- AI capabilities continue improving at recent pace
- AGI (artificial general intelligence) arrives 2035-2045
- Robotics costs fall dramatically (Moore's Law equivalent)
- Job displacement reaches 3-5% per year in peak periods

**Key Indicators**:
- AI passes 95%+ on broad cognitive benchmarks
- Humanoid robots deployed at >1 million units in service sector
- Major industry (trucking, retail, customer service) experiences >30% workforce reduction
- Productivity-wage gap exceeds 50%

**What This World Looks Like**:
- Significant disruption concentrated in 10-15 year window
- Millions displaced faster than retraining can absorb
- Political instability if safety nets inadequate
- Those prepared benefit enormously; those unprepared suffer

**Policy Implications**:
- Core Automation Dividend framework implemented on proposed schedule
- Transition support critical in peak displacement years
- Meaning infrastructure must be ready before mass displacement
- International coordination desirable but not required

### Scenario 3: Sudden Transformation (5-10 Years)

**Assumptions**:
- Breakthroughs accelerate AI capabilities beyond projections
- AGI arrives before 2030
- Physical automation follows rapidly
- Job displacement reaches 5-10% per year

**Key Indicators**:
- AI achieves human-level performance across most cognitive domains
- Major tech companies announce workforce reductions >50%
- Multiple industries automate simultaneously
- Social unrest in response to rapid displacement

**What This World Looks Like**:
- Crisis conditions requiring emergency response
- Existing institutions overwhelmed
- Political extremism if people feel abandoned
- Either rapid adaptation or serious social breakdown

**Policy Implications**:
- Emergency implementation of Automation Dividend
- Immediate Citizen's Royalty deployment (deficit-funded if necessary)
- Transition support becomes triage
- Framework becomes survival infrastructure

## Part II: Probability Assessment

We assign rough probabilities to each scenario:

| Scenario | Probability | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Gradual (30-50 years) | 25% | Possible if current AI is near ceiling; historical precedent for slower transitions |
| Accelerated (10-20 years) | 55% | Most consistent with current trajectory; neither assumes breakthroughs nor plateaus |
| Sudden (5-10 years) | 20% | Requires breakthroughs but such breakthroughs have occurred unexpectedly before |

**Key Uncertainty**: We genuinely don't know. AI researchers' predictions vary by decades. The honest answer is deep uncertainty, which is precisely why we design for robustness.

---

## Part III: Trigger-Based Implementation

Rather than committing to fixed timelines, we tie policy activation to observable indicators.

### Tier 1 Indicators: Early Warning

| Indicator | Threshold | Data Source | Current Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| AI benchmark scores | >90% on AGI evaluations | MLPerf, ARC-AGI | ~70% (Dec 2025) |
| Tech sector unemployment | >6% for 3 consecutive months | BLS | ~5% |
| Productivity-wage divergence | >30% from 2020 baseline | BLS, BEA | ~20% |
| AI capital investment | >$500B annual (US) | Federal Reserve | ~$200B |

**Response When Triggered**: Accelerate disclosure requirements, expand research funding, begin legislative drafting.

### Tier 2 Indicators: Active Preparation

| Indicator | Threshold | Data Source |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Sector-specific displacement | >10% workforce reduction in major sector | BLS, industry reports |
| AI capability threshold | 95% on broad cognitive benchmarks | Standard evaluations |
| Humanoid robot deployments | >100,000 units in service sector | Industry tracking |
| Regional tech unemployment | >10% in any major metro | BLS |

**Response When Triggered**: Implement automation tax (Phase 1), launch Citizen's Royalty pilots in affected regions, activate transition support programs.

### Tier 3 Indicators: Full Activation

| Indicator | Threshold | Data Source |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| National displacement rate | >5% workforce displacement in 12 months | BLS |
| Multi-sector automation | >3 major sectors experiencing >20% reduction | Industry data |
| AGI declaration | Major lab announces AGI achievement | Lab statements |
| Social instability | Automation-related civil unrest | DHS, news monitoring |

**Response When Triggered**: Full implementation of automation tax, national Citizen's Royalty rollout, emergency transition support, meaning infrastructure acceleration.

### Tier 4 Indicators: Emergency Response

| Indicator | Threshold | Response |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| National unemployment | >15% | Deficit-funded emergency Citizen's Royalty |
| Widespread civil unrest | Multiple cities, sustained | National emergency declaration |
| Economic collapse indicators | GDP decline >10%, market crash >40% | All emergency economic powers |

## Part IV: Policy Robustness Analysis

Each major policy is evaluated for its value across scenarios:

### Automation Tax

| Scenario | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Gradual | Medium | Modest revenue, but creates useful precedent and infrastructure |
| Accelerated | High | Core funding mechanism for transition |
| Sudden | Critical | Must be implemented rapidly, framework pre-built helps |

**Robustness**: High. Valuable in all scenarios, critical in likely ones.

### Sovereign Wealth Fund

| Scenario | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Gradual | High | Builds long-term national wealth regardless of automation |
| Accelerated | High | Provides sustainable funding for dividends |
| Sudden | Medium | Less time to build, but structure helps rapid deployment |

**Robustness**: High. Sovereign wealth is valuable regardless of automation speed.

### Citizen's Royalty

| Scenario | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Gradual | Medium | Serves poverty reduction, less critical for displacement |
| Accelerated | Critical | Essential for displaced workers |
| Sudden | Critical | Emergency deployment required |

**Robustness**: High. Some form of Citizen's Royalty valuable in all scenarios, critical in most likely ones.

### Transition Support Programs

| Scenario | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Gradual | Low-Medium | Existing programs may suffice with modest expansion |
| Accelerated | High | Critical for workers in transition |
| Sudden | Critical | Triage function, prevent worst outcomes |

**Robustness**: Medium-High. Essential in likely scenarios.

### Meaning Infrastructure

| Scenario | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Gradual | Medium | Community investment valuable regardless |
| Accelerated | High | Needed as work-based community erodes |
| Sudden | Critical | Must absorb rapid social dislocation |

**Robustness**: High. Community infrastructure valuable in all scenarios.

### Truth Infrastructure (Blockchain Verification)

| Scenario | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Gradual | Medium | Deepfakes less urgent if AI slows |
| Accelerated | High | AI-generated content requires verification |
| Sudden | High | Critical for maintaining trust during crisis |

**Robustness**: Medium-High. Valuable but less dependent on automation timeline.

### Sound Money Options

| Scenario | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Gradual | Medium | Protection against inflation regardless |
| Accelerated | Medium | Same value proposition |
| Sudden | High | Alternative if monetary system stressed |

**Robustness**: Medium. Valuable independently of automation.

## Part V: Resource Allocation Under Uncertainty

Given uncertainty, how should we allocate effort and resources?

### High Priority (Invest Heavily Now)

1. **Automation tax design and legislation drafting**: Needed in most scenarios, takes time to build
2. **Sovereign wealth fund structure**: Valuable regardless, takes time to establish
3. **Trigger monitoring infrastructure**: Essential for responsive policy
4. **Transition support program design**: Needed for any displacement

### Medium Priority (Build, But Pace to Indicators)

1. **Full Citizen's Royalty implementation infrastructure**: Critical if needed, but can scale with triggers
2. **Meaning infrastructure**: Important but can expand as displacement occurs
3. **International coordination**: Valuable but not blocking

### Lower Priority (Prepare, Activate on Triggers)

1. **Emergency Citizen's Royalty deployment**: Have plans ready, deploy if Tier 3-4 triggers
2. **Maximum transition support**: Scale with actual displacement levels
3. **National service corps at scale**: Expand as work-based community declines

## Part VI: What We're Watching

### Near-Term Indicators (2025-2027)

- **AI capability trajectory**: Do models continue improving or plateau?
- **Enterprise AI adoption**: Are companies actually deploying at scale?
- **Labor market response**: Early displacement or absorption?
- **Robot cost curves**: Is physical automation becoming economical?

### Medium-Term Indicators (2027-2030)

- **AGI progress**: How close are frontier labs?
- **Sector-specific impacts**: Which industries first?
- **Political response**: Are other nations acting?
- **Social adaptation**: How are communities responding?

### Signposts for Scenario Determination

**Signals We're in Gradual Scenario**:
- AI progress slows significantly
- "AI winter" discourse increases
- Job creation keeps pace with displacement
- Robotics remains expensive and limited

**Signals We're in Accelerated Scenario**:
- AI capabilities continue current trajectory
- Multiple industries experience significant automation
- Displacement outpaces job creation in some sectors
- Robotics costs fall rapidly

**Signals We're in Sudden Scenario**:
- Breakthrough announcements (AGI claims)
- Rapid, unexpected displacement in white-collar sectors
- Major companies announce massive workforce reductions
- Social/political instability emerges

## Part VII: Adaptive Strategy

### Decision Points

| Year | Decision | Options |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2026 | Assessment of AI trajectory | Accelerate, maintain, or slow implementation |
| 2028 | First major policy package | Full framework or targeted interventions |
| 2030 | Mid-course correction | Adjust based on 5 years of data |
| 2035 | Full implementation decision | Complete rollout or continued phasing |

### Commitment to Adaptation

We commit to:

1. **Quarterly indicator review**: Assess triggers against thresholds
2. **Annual strategy update**: Revise probabilities and priorities
3. **Transparency about uncertainty**: Communicate what we know and don't know
4. **Rapid response capability**: Ability to accelerate if signals indicate

---

## Conclusion

The automation transformation is real, but its timeline is genuinely uncertain. Rather than pretending to know what we don't, we've designed a framework that:

1. **Works across scenarios**: Policies valuable in gradual, accelerated, or sudden transformation
2. **Uses observable triggers**: Activation based on evidence, not predictions
3. **Builds infrastructure early**: Long-lead-time investments start now
4. **Scales to conditions**: Intensity of response matches severity of displacement
5. **Adapts continuously**: Regular reassessment and adjustment

The worst outcome would be being unprepared for rapid transformation. The second-worst would be massive over-investment for transformation that doesn't occur. Our framework minimizes both risks.
