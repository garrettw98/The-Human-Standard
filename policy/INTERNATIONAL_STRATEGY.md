# INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY
## Global Coordination for the Automation Age
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

The Human Standard is designed for U.S. implementation, but automation is a global phenomenon. Without international coordination, capital flight, regulatory arbitrage, and competitive pressure could undermine domestic policy. This document presents a comprehensive international strategy that addresses these challenges while remaining achievable without full global cooperation.

**The Core Principle**: International coordination is desirable but not required. We design policies that work unilaterally while pursuing bilateral and multilateral cooperation.

---

## Part I: The International Challenge

### Risks of Unilateral Action

| Risk | Mechanism | Severity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Capital flight | Companies relocate to avoid automation tax | Medium |
| Regulatory arbitrage | Production moves to unregulated jurisdictions | High |
| Competitive disadvantage | Countries without automation tax have lower costs | Medium |
| Political backlash | "U.S. is hamstringing itself" narrative | Medium |
| Technology leakage | AI development moves offshore | Low-Medium |

### Why Unilateral Action Is Still Viable

| Factor | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Market access | Companies need U.S. consumers regardless of HQ |
| Border adjustments | Imports can be taxed at the border |
| Infrastructure dependence | U.S. infrastructure, talent, institutions are sticky |
| Demonstration effect | Successful policy creates pressure for adoption elsewhere |
| Moral leadership | First mover shapes global norms |

---

## Part II: Unilateral Tools

### Border Automation Adjustments

**Concept**: Apply automation tax equivalent to imports from countries without similar taxation.

**Mechanism**:
1. Estimate automation content of imported goods (by sector)
2. Apply adjustment (tariff) equal to domestic automation tax that would have applied
3. Rebate adjustment for exports (to maintain competitiveness)

**Implementation**:

| Sector | Estimated Automation Content | Border Adjustment Rate |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Electronics | High (40-60%) | 5-8% |
| Automotive | High (50-70%) | 6-10% |
| Apparel | Medium (20-40%) | 2-5% |
| Agriculture | Medium (30-50%) | 4-7% |
| Professional Services | Low (10-30%) | 1-4% |

**Legal Framework**:
- WTO-compatible as environmental/social adjustment (precedent: carbon border adjustment)
- Bilateral negotiation option for compliant countries
- Dispute resolution through existing trade mechanisms

### Destination-Based Taxation

**Concept**: Tax based on where consumers are, not where production occurs.

**For Digital Services**:
- Tax advertising revenue based on where ads are viewed
- Tax subscriptions based on subscriber location
- Tax data monetization based on data subject location

**For Physical Goods**:
- Border adjustment handles this naturally
- Place of consumption determines tax jurisdiction

**Effect**: Companies can't escape taxation by moving production/HQ offshore if they want U.S. market access.

### Digital Permanent Establishment

**Concept**: Significant digital presence in a market creates tax obligation.

**Thresholds**:
- >$25M revenue from U.S. users
- >10M U.S. users
- >1M U.S. data subjects whose data is monetized

**If Threshold Met**:
- Subject to U.S. automation tax on U.S.-attributed value
- Required to register, report, comply with domestic rules

## Part III: Bilateral Strategy

### Tier 1: Close Allies (Year 1-2)

**Target Countries**: UK, EU, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea

**Approach**:
- Propose mutual recognition of automation taxes
- Coordinate on AI safety standards
- Align digital services tax frameworks
- Joint approach to training data rights

**Incentives for Participation**:
- Waiver of border adjustments
- Technology sharing agreements
- Coordinated enforcement
- Joint investment in AI safety research

### Tier 2: Major Trading Partners (Year 2-4)

**Target Countries**: Mexico, India, Brazil, others

**Approach**:
- Negotiate automation tax equivalence agreements
- Provide technical assistance for implementation
- Phase-in border adjustments with compliance timelines
- Flexible implementation acknowledging development levels

### Tier 3: Competitive Relationships (Ongoing)

**Target Countries**: China, Russia, others

**Approach**:
- Maintain border adjustments
- Pursue narrow cooperation on existential risks
- Defensive measures against AI-enabled threats
- Compete on technology development, not regulatory race to bottom

---

## Part IV: Multilateral Strategy

### Proposed: International AI Governance Organization

**Modeled On**: IAEA (nuclear), IPCC (climate), WTO (trade)

**Functions**:
- Develop international AI safety standards
- Monitor compliance with agreed norms
- Facilitate technology sharing for beneficial AI
- Coordinate response to AI-related crises

**Governance**:
- All nations eligible to join
- Technical standards set by expert body
- Enforcement through member state coordination
- Graduated participation based on AI development level

### Proposed: Global Automation Tax Minimum

**Modeled On**: OECD Global Minimum Tax (Pillar Two)

**Structure**:
- Minimum 10% automation tax rate for participating countries
- Countries below minimum face border adjustments from participants
- Flexibility on implementation details
- Revenue stays with collecting country

**Phased Implementation**:
| Year | Minimum Rate | Participating Countries (Target) |
|------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | 5% | 10 (core allies) |
| 3 | 7.5% | 25 (OECD+) |
| 5 | 10% | 50+ (global) |

### AI Safety Treaty

**Purpose**: Prevent worst AI outcomes through international agreement

**Elements**:
- Prohibition on autonomous weapons (LAWS)
- Notification requirements for advanced AI development
- Safety testing requirements before deployment
- Information sharing on incidents and near-misses
- Joint research on AI alignment

**Verification**:
- Compute monitoring (large training runs are detectable)
- Incident reporting requirements
- Inspection rights for suspected violations

---

## Part V: China Strategy

### The Reality

Full cooperation with China on AI governance is unlikely given:
- Geopolitical competition
- Different governance philosophies
- Mutual distrust
- Technological rivalry

### Narrow Cooperation (Pursue)

Despite competition, some cooperation is possible and essential:

| Area | Rationale | Approach |
|------|-----------|----------|
| AI safety research | Mutual interest in avoiding catastrophe | Academic and research exchanges |
| Existential risk | Both countries face same threats | Quiet diplomatic channel |
| Autonomous weapons | Mutual destruction risk | Arms control negotiations |
| Incident notification | Early warning benefits both | Confidential reporting channel |

### Competitive Stance (Maintain)

| Area | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Technology development | Invest heavily to maintain parity |
| Talent retention | Immigration reform to attract/keep AI researchers |
| Export controls | Limit transfer of advanced AI capabilities |
| Defensive AI | Develop countermeasures for AI-enabled threats |
| Alliance coordination | Unified approach with democratic allies |

### What Not To Do

- Don't assume cooperation is impossible (misses opportunities)
- Don't assume competition requires hostility (both lose)
- Don't let competition drive unsafe AI development (race to bottom)
- Don't isolate completely (increases risk of miscalculation)

## Part VI: Addressing Specific Concerns

### "Companies Will Just Move to Ireland/Singapore/Caymans"

**Response**:
1. **Border adjustments**: Products sold in U.S. face U.S. automation tax regardless of production location
2. **Digital taxation**: Revenue from U.S. users taxed in U.S.
3. **Market access**: U.S. is too large a market to abandon
4. **Infrastructure**: AI development requires infrastructure (power, talent, data centers) that concentrates in few places
5. **OECD coordination**: Global minimum tax precedent

**Evidence**: Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax didn't cause mass exodus from U.S. Companies go where markets and infrastructure are.

### "China Will Out-Compete Us"

**Response**:
1. **Investment**: We invest automation tax revenue in competitiveness (R&D, infrastructure, education)
2. **Values**: U.S. AI that respects human values is more attractive globally
3. **Alliances**: Coordinated approach with allies creates larger bloc than China alone
4. **Border adjustments**: Chinese imports face adjustment, neutralizing cost advantage
5. **Historical precedent**: Environmental and labor standards didn't destroy U.S. manufacturing competitiveness

### "Trade Partners Will Retaliate"

**Response**:
1. **WTO-compatible**: Border adjustments structured to be legal under trade law
2. **Mutual benefit**: Partners who adopt similar policies get waiver
3. **Negotiation**: Bilateral deals available
4. **Precedent**: Carbon border adjustments (CBAM) being implemented without trade war

---

## Part VII: Immigration and Talent

### The Challenge

AI leadership requires talent. If the U.S. is perceived as hostile to technology, talent may leave.

### Immigration Reform for AI Era

| Category | Proposal | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| AI researchers | Automatic green card for AI PhDs | Retain talent trained in U.S. |
| Entrepreneur visa | Path to residency for AI startup founders | Capture value creation |
| Skills-based | Priority for AI/tech skills | Fill workforce needs |
| Startup visa | Residence tied to job creation | Encourage U.S.-based companies |
| Investor visa | Reform to prioritize productive investment | Capital for AI development |

### Brain Drain Prevention

- Competitive research funding
- Public-private research partnerships
- Quality of life investments (healthcare, education, infrastructure)
- Clear path to permanent residency for temporary visa holders

---

## Part VIII: International Citizen's Royalty Coordination

### The Challenge

If U.S. implements Citizen's Royalty but trading partners don't:
- Manufactured goods in Citizen's Royalty countries cost more (higher wages/labor share)
- Immigration pressure from non-Citizen's Royalty countries
- Competitive concerns

### Responses

**For Trade**:
- Border adjustments account for labor share differences
- Citizen's Royalty countries have more consumers (effective demand)
- Quality of life attracts talent and capital

**For Immigration**:
- Residency requirements for Citizen's Royalty (5-year path)
- Skills-based immigration prioritized
- Development assistance to reduce push factors

**Long-Term**:
- Demonstration effect: Successful Citizen's Royalty creates pressure for adoption elsewhere
- International Citizen's Royalty floor: As automation tax becomes global, so does dividend

---

## Part IX: Implementation Timeline

---

## Conclusion

International coordination is challenging but achievable. We don't need global consensus to implement effective policy—unilateral tools (border adjustments, destination-based taxation) enable action while coordination develops.

The sequence matters:
1. First, implement domestically with border adjustments
2. Then, coordinate with allies
3. Then, expand coalition
4. Eventually, near-universal adoption

This has worked before for environmental standards, labor rights, tax coordination. It can work for automation policy.

America can lead. The world will follow—not immediately, not universally, but eventually. That's how global norms develop.
