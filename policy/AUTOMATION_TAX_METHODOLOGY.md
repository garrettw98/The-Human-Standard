# AUTOMATION TAX METHODOLOGY
## A Triangulated Approach to Measuring and Taxing Automation
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

Taxing automation is conceptually simple but practically complex. "What counts as a robot?" is the wrong question—we don't tax robots, we tax the economic value generated by automation. This document presents a triangulated methodology using three independent measurement approaches, designed to be robust against gaming and administratively feasible.

**The Core Principle**: When companies substitute machines for human labor, the productivity gains should contribute to the common wealth. The challenge is measurement, not principle.

---

## Part I: Why Triangulation?

### The Problem with Single Metrics

Any single measurement approach can be gamed:

| Approach | Gaming Vector |
|----------|---------------|
| Count robots | Redefine what's a "robot," use software instead of hardware |
| Measure productivity | Shift reporting periods, manipulate baselines |
| Track capital investment | Reclassify automation as non-automation |
| Monitor layoffs | Attrition instead of layoffs, contractors instead of employees |

### The Triangulation Solution

Use three independent measurement approaches. Tax liability = highest of the three. Gaming one approach typically increases liability under another.

**The Three Approaches**:
1. **Capital-Labor Substitution Index** (input-based)
2. **Revenue-Per-Employee Tax** (output-based)
3. **AI Compute Tax** (technology-based)

---

## Part II: Approach 1 — Capital-Labor Substitution Index

### Concept

Compare a company's capital-to-labor ratio against industry baseline. Excess capital intensity indicates automation.

### Formula

```
CLSI = (Company Capital per Worker) / (Industry Median Capital per Worker)

Automation Tax Base = Revenue × (CLSI - 1) × Rate
(Only applies when CLSI > 1.5)
```

### Measurement

**Capital**: Total depreciable capital assets (machinery, equipment, software, AI systems)
- Source: IRS depreciation schedules, already reported

**Workers**: Full-time equivalent employees
- Source: Payroll tax filings, already reported

**Industry Median**: Calculated by IRS from aggregate filings
- Published annually by industry (NAICS code)
- 3-year rolling average to smooth fluctuations

### Example

| Metric | Company A | Industry Median |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Capital Assets | $500M | - |
| Employees (FTE) | 1,000 | - |
| Capital per Worker | $500K | $200K |
| CLSI | 2.5 | 1.0 |

Tax Calculation:
- Revenue: $1B
- Excess CLSI: 2.5 - 1.0 = 1.5
- Tax Base: $1B × 1.5 × 0.67 (adjustment factor) = $1B
- Tax Rate (Phase 4): 15%
- **Tax Liability: $150M**

### Advantages

- Uses existing IRS data
- Hard to manipulate capital and employment counts simultaneously
- Industry-specific baselines account for sector differences

### Limitations

- Doesn't capture software automation well (low capital, high productivity)
- New industries lack baseline data
- Conglomerates can obscure through averaging

## Part III: Approach 2 — Revenue-Per-Employee Tax

### Concept

Companies generating exceptional revenue with few employees are benefiting from automation. Tax the excess.

### Formula

```
RPE = Annual Revenue / Employee Count

Tax Base = (RPE - Industry Threshold) × Employee Count × Rate
(Only applies when RPE > Industry Threshold × 2)
```

### Measurement

**Revenue**: Gross revenue from operations
- Source: Tax filings, already reported

**Employees**: Full-time equivalent employees
- Source: Payroll tax filings, already reported

**Industry Threshold**: Published by sector
- Based on 75th percentile of industry RPE
- Updated annually

### Example

| Metric | Company B | Industry 75th Percentile |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Revenue | $100B | - |
| Employees | 50,000 | - |
| RPE | $2M | $400K |
| Excess RPE | $1.6M | - |

Tax Calculation:
- Excess RPE: $2M - $400K = $1.6M
- Tax Base: $1.6M × 50,000 = $80B
- Adjustment Factor: 0.05 (to avoid double-counting)
- Adjusted Base: $4B
- Tax Rate (Phase 4): 15%
- **Tax Liability: $600M**

### Sector-Specific Thresholds

| Sector | RPE Threshold (75th percentile) |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Software/Tech | $500K |
| Manufacturing | $250K |
| Retail | $150K |
| Healthcare | $200K |
| Financial Services | $400K |
| Professional Services | $300K |

### Advantages

- Simple, hard to game without reducing revenue or hiring
- Captures software automation (high RPE companies)
- Transparent and predictable

### Limitations

- High-margin businesses (not necessarily automated) may be captured
- Doesn't account for industry-specific factors well
- New companies may have high RPE before scaling

### Adjustments

- **Startup Exemption**: Companies <5 years old, <$100M revenue exempt
- **High-Margin Adjustment**: Reduce rate for industries with structurally high margins (software)
- **Growth Adjustment**: Reduce rate for companies growing employment >10% annually

## Part IV: Approach 3 — AI Compute Tax

### Concept

Tax expenditure on AI compute resources used for commercial deployment. This directly targets AI automation regardless of industry.

### Formula

```
AI Compute Tax = Commercial AI Compute Spending × Rate
```

### Measurement

**Commercial AI Compute**: Cloud AI services + on-premise AI infrastructure used for customer-facing or revenue-generating applications

- Source: Mandatory reporting by cloud providers + company disclosure
- Excludes: R&D, internal tools, non-commercial applications

### Reporting Requirements

Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) report:
- Total AI/ML service spend by customer
- Customer-designated commercial vs. R&D allocation

Companies report:
- On-premise AI infrastructure costs
- Commercial vs. non-commercial allocation

### Rate Structure

| Compute Spending | Tax Rate |
|------------------|----------|
| First $10M | 0% (exempt) |
| $10M - $100M | 5% |
| $100M - $1B | 10% |
| $1B+ | 15% |

### Example

| Metric | Company C |
|--------|-----------|
| AWS AI Services (commercial) | $200M |
| Azure AI Services (commercial) | $100M |
| On-premise AI infrastructure | $50M |
| Total Commercial AI Compute | $350M |

Tax Calculation:
- First $10M: 0% = $0
- $10M - $100M ($90M): 5% = $4.5M
- $100M - $350M ($250M): 10% = $25M
- **Tax Liability: $29.5M**

### Advantages

- Directly targets AI automation
- Easy to administer through cloud providers
- Scales with AI deployment

### Limitations

- Doesn't capture non-AI automation (traditional robotics)
- May shift compute to less efficient on-premise
- R&D classification can be gamed

### Anti-Gaming Provisions

- **Audit rights**: IRS can audit R&D vs. commercial classification
- **Safe harbor**: Clear guidelines for what qualifies as R&D
- **Consistency requirement**: Classification must be consistent across years
- **Cloud provider liability**: Providers face penalties for misreporting

## Part V: Triangulation in Practice

### Combining the Approaches

Each company calculates liability under all three approaches. Tax owed = highest of the three.

| Company | CLSI Tax | RPE Tax | Compute Tax | Liability |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Heavy Manufacturing (robots) | $150M | $40M | $5M | **$150M** |
| Tech Platform (software) | $20M | $600M | $30M | **$600M** |
| AI-Native Company | $10M | $100M | $200M | **$200M** |
| Traditional Business | $5M | $10M | $1M | **$10M** |

### Anti-Gaming Dynamics

**Scenario**: Company tries to reduce CLSI liability by reclassifying automation as operating expense.
**Result**: RPE increases (same revenue, same employees, but less capital = suspicious pattern).
**Outcome**: No net tax reduction; increased audit risk.

**Scenario**: Company tries to reduce RPE by hiring unnecessary employees.
**Result**: Legitimate employment = lower tax (this is the intended incentive).
**Outcome**: Either genuine employment (policy goal achieved) or fraudulent payroll (auditable).

**Scenario**: Company tries to reduce Compute Tax by moving to on-premise.
**Result**: Capital increases (captured by CLSI) and compute still reportable.
**Outcome**: No net tax reduction.

## Part VI: Administration

### New IRS Division

**Automation Tax Administration (ATA)**
- Responsible for collecting automation tax
- Maintains industry baselines
- Conducts audits
- Publishes guidance

### Reporting Requirements

| Filing | Frequency | Required By |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Form 1120-AT (Automation Tax) | Annual | Companies >$100M revenue |
| Schedule AT-C (Compute) | Annual | Companies using cloud AI |
| Form 4797-AT (Capital) | Annual | Companies with >$10M automation capital |

### Audit Priority

High priority:
- CLSI > 3.0 (extreme capital intensity)
- RPE > 5x industry threshold
- Compute classified 80%+ as R&D
- Significant year-over-year changes in classification

### Appeals Process

1. Initial determination by ATA
2. IRS Appeals Office review
3. Tax Court litigation if unresolved
4. Standard IRS appeal rights apply

---

## Part VIII: Revenue Projections

### Methodology

Projections based on:
- Current automation deployment rates
- Expected AI/robotics cost curves
- Historical adoption patterns
- Gaming/avoidance assumptions (30% haircut)

### Conservative Scenario (Gradual Automation)

| Year | CLSI Revenue | RPE Revenue | Compute Revenue | Total |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2027 | $10B | $8B | $2B | **$20B** |
| 2030 | $25B | $25B | $10B | **$60B** |
| 2035 | $40B | $60B | $25B | **$125B** |

### Base Case Scenario (Accelerated Automation)

| Year | CLSI Revenue | RPE Revenue | Compute Revenue | Total |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2027 | $15B | $15B | $5B | **$35B** |
| 2030 | $50B | $60B | $25B | **$135B** |
| 2035 | $100B | $150B | $75B | **$325B** |

### Aggressive Scenario (Rapid Automation)

| Year | CLSI Revenue | RPE Revenue | Compute Revenue | Total |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2027 | $25B | $25B | $10B | **$60B** |
| 2030 | $100B | $120B | $50B | **$270B** |
| 2035 | $200B | $300B | $150B | **$650B** |

**Note**: These are scenarios, not predictions. Actual revenue depends on automation trajectory and enforcement effectiveness.

## Part IX: Relationship to Payroll Tax

### The Shift, Not Increase

For every dollar of automation tax collected, payroll taxes on human employment are reduced. This shifts the tax burden from human labor to machine labor without increasing total business taxation.

### Payroll Tax Reduction Schedule

| Automation Tax Rate | Payroll Tax Reduction |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| 5% | 5 percentage points |
| 10% | 7.5 percentage points |
| 15% | 10 percentage points |

### Net Effect by Business Type

| Business Type | Automation Tax | Payroll Tax Savings | Net Effect |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Heavy automation | High | Low (few employees) | Pays more |
| Mixed | Medium | Medium | Roughly neutral |
| Labor-intensive | Low | High (many employees) | Pays less |

**This is the intended effect.** We want to make human employment relatively more attractive.

---

## Part X: Honest Assessment

### What We're Confident About

- The principle is sound: automation gains should contribute to common wealth
- Multiple approaches are more robust than single approaches
- Phase-in allows adjustment based on experience

### What's Uncertain

- Exact revenue projections (high variance across scenarios)
- Gaming vectors we haven't anticipated
- International competitive effects
- Optimal rate structure

### Commitment to Adaptation

- Annual methodology review
- Adjust rates based on behavioral response
- Close loopholes as identified
- Transparent reporting on revenue and avoidance

---

## Conclusion

Taxing automation is administratively feasible. By using three independent measurement approaches, we create a robust system that's difficult to game and captures automation across different forms (physical, software, AI). The phase-in schedule allows learning and adjustment. The payroll tax offset ensures this is a shift in what we tax, not an increase in total taxation.

The alternative—watching automation gains concentrate while the tax base erodes—is far worse than the administrative complexity of implementation.
