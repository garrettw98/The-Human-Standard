# TRANSITION SUPPORT
## Immediate Help for Workers Displaced by Automation
### The Human Standard

---

## Executive Summary

Workers displaced by automation today cannot wait 20 years for a mature sovereign wealth fund. This document presents a comprehensive transition support framework that provides immediate, substantial help while longer-term systems are built.

**The Core Principle**: No one should be left behind during the transition to an automated economy. The cost of supporting displaced workers is far less than the cost of abandonment—in human suffering, social instability, and political backlash.

## Part I: The Transition Gap

### The Problem

- Full Automation Dividend payments are years away
- Early-phase dividends ($200-300/month) don't cover displacement
- Workers losing $50,000+ jobs need immediate support
- Existing unemployment insurance is inadequate for structural displacement

### The Gap Period

| Year | Automation Dividend | Displacement Need | Gap |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|
| 1-3 | $0-100/month | $3,000+/month | $2,900+ |
| 4-6 | $200-300/month | $3,000+/month | $2,700+ |
| 7-10 | $400-600/month | $3,000+/month | $2,400+ |
| 10+ | $800+/month | Declining (adaptation) | Narrowing |

### Who Needs Support

- Factory workers displaced by robotics
- Truck drivers displaced by autonomous vehicles
- Customer service workers displaced by AI
- Administrative workers displaced by automation
- Retail workers displaced by e-commerce + automation
- And increasingly: white-collar professionals (legal, financial, medical)

---

## Part II: Automation Displacement Insurance (ADI)

### Overview

A new social insurance program specifically for automation-driven displacement. Not traditional unemployment insurance—structured for structural, not cyclical, unemployment.

### Eligibility

**Primary Criteria**:
1. Lost job within past 6 months
2. Job loss attributable to automation (see determination process below)
3. Previously employed for 12+ months
4. Actively engaged with transition services (retraining, job search)

**Automation Determination Process**:
- Employer attestation of automation-related reduction
- OR industry-wide automation designation (e.g., "autonomous trucking" sector)
- OR individual appeal to Automation Displacement Board
- Presumption: If employer replaced position with automation, burden on employer to prove otherwise

### Benefit Structure

| Duration | Benefit Level |
|----------|---------------|
| Months 1-12 | 80% of prior wage (up to $80,000 cap = $5,333/month max) |
| Months 13-18 | 70% of prior wage (same cap) |
| Months 19-24 | 60% of prior wage (same cap) |
| Month 25+ | Transition to general Citizen's Royalty + extended support if engaged in retraining |

### Comparison to Current Unemployment Insurance

| Feature | Current UI | Automation Displacement Insurance |
|---------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Duration | 26 weeks typical | 24 months |
| Benefit level | ~45% of wages | 80% declining to 60% |
| Retraining integration | Minimal | Built-in requirement |
| Stigma | "Unemployed" | "Transitioning" |
| Funding | Payroll tax | Automation tax |

### Funding

- Funded from Phase 1-2 automation tax revenue
- Supplemented by reallocation from traditional UI (declining as ADI expands)
- Early years: Federal general fund bridge if automation tax insufficient

---

## Part III: Emergency Regional Citizen's Royalty Pilots

### Trigger Criteria

When a region experiences acute displacement, emergency Citizen's Royalty pilots activate.

**Trigger Thresholds**:
- Metro area unemployment rate >12% for 3+ months
- Single employer layoff >5,000 in region
- Industry-wide regional displacement >15% of sector
- Governor request with documented displacement

### Pilot Structure

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Benefit | $1,000/month per adult |
| Duration | 2 years minimum, renewable |
| Eligibility | All adults in designated region |
| Funding | Federal emergency appropriation + automation tax |

### Designated Regions (Anticipated)

Based on automation exposure analysis:

| Region | Primary Risk | Timeline |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Detroit metro | Manufacturing automation | Near-term |
| Inland Empire, CA | Warehouse/logistics | Near-term |
| Central Valley, CA | Agricultural automation | Medium-term |
| Appalachian coal regions | Energy transition + automation | Ongoing |
| Rural Midwest | Agricultural automation | Medium-term |
| Trucking corridor cities | Autonomous vehicles | Medium-term |

### Data Collection

Emergency pilots serve as large-scale Citizen's Royalty experiments:
- Employment effects measured
- Entrepreneurship tracked
- Health outcomes monitored
- Community effects studied
- Results inform national rollout

---

## Part IV: Relocation Assistance

### The Problem

Displacement is geographically concentrated. Opportunity is elsewhere. Mobility enables recovery.

### Assistance Package

| Component | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| Moving costs | Up to $15,000 (actual expenses) |
| Housing assistance | 6 months rent in new location (up to $2,500/month) |
| Job search support | Placement services in new location |
| Family support | School transition assistance, spouse job search |
| Return option | One-time return assistance if relocation fails (within 2 years) |

### Eligibility

- Received ADI benefits
- Moving to designated "opportunity zone" (areas with job growth + affordable housing)
- OR moving to location with confirmed job offer

### Opportunity Zone Designation

Criteria for designation:
- Job growth rate >3% annually
- Housing affordability (median home <4x median income)
- Available workforce training programs
- Quality of life indicators (schools, healthcare)

Updated annually by Labor Department.

## Part V: Rapid Retraining Programs

### The Problem

Traditional retraining programs have poor outcomes. We need faster, more effective approaches.

### Rapid Retraining Academy (RRA)

**Structure**:
- 6-24 month intensive programs
- Focus on automation-resistant skills
- Paid at 80% of prior wage during training
- Job placement guarantee (or continued support)

**Target Skills**:

| Category | Example Programs | Duration |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Healthcare | Nursing, medical tech, care coordination | 12-24 months |
| Skilled trades | Electrical, plumbing, HVAC (in demand from construction/retrofit) | 6-18 months |
| Technology | Cybersecurity, cloud administration, AI oversight | 6-12 months |
| Human services | Social work, counseling, community health | 12-24 months |
| Entrepreneurship | Small business development, freelance skills | 6-12 months |

**Partnership Model**:
- Federal funding
- Community college/trade school delivery
- Employer partnerships for placement
- Outcome-based payments to providers

### Online + Hybrid Options

- Coursera/edX partnership for asynchronous learning
- Local cohort meetings for support
- Virtual reality for hands-on training
- Credential recognition across states

### Credential Recognition

Problem: Existing credentials often not recognized across states/employers.

Solution:
- Federal credential recognition framework
- Skills-based hiring requirements for federal contractors
- Incentives for employers to accept RRA credentials

## Part VI: Employer Responsibilities

### Automation Notification Requirement

Companies planning automation-driven workforce reductions must:

| Workforce Size | Notice Period | Requirement |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| <100 employees | 60 days | Written notice to affected workers |
| 100-500 employees | 90 days | Notice + transition plan |
| 500+ employees | 180 days | Notice + transition plan + community impact assessment |

### Transition Funding

Companies with >500 employees conducting automation-driven layoffs must contribute to worker transition:

| Layoff Size | Contribution per Worker |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 100-500 | $5,000 |
| 500-1,000 | $7,500 |
| 1,000+ | $10,000 |

Contributions fund:
- ADI supplemental benefits
- Retraining slots
- Relocation assistance

### Tax Treatment

Transition contributions are:
- Tax deductible as business expense
- Credit against automation tax liability (50% offset)
- Required regardless of company profitability

---

## Part VII: Mental Health and Community Support

### The Hidden Cost

Job loss is associated with:
- Increased depression and anxiety
- Higher substance abuse
- Elevated suicide risk
- Family breakdown
- Community deterioration

### Support Services

| Service | Availability | Funding |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Free mental health counseling | All ADI recipients + family | Federal grant to community health centers |
| Peer support groups | Weekly in affected communities | Community organization grants |
| Financial counseling | All ADI recipients | Integrated with ADI enrollment |
| Family services | At-risk families identified through ADI | State block grants |
| Addiction treatment | All ADI recipients | Medicaid expansion |

### Community Stabilization Grants

When major employer announces automation-driven closure:

| Grant Type | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Emergency services | $5-20M | Maintain police, fire, schools during tax base decline |
| Economic development | $10-50M | Attract new employers, support local business |
| Infrastructure | $20-100M | Projects that create jobs during transition |

---

## Part VIII: Early Warning System

### Indicators Monitored

| Indicator | Source | Update Frequency |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| AI/robotics deployment by sector | Industry surveys, patent data | Quarterly |
| Job posting trends | Indeed, LinkedIn, BLS | Monthly |
| Productivity-employment divergence | BLS | Quarterly |
| Company automation announcements | News monitoring, SEC filings | Real-time |
| Regional employment changes | BLS, state labor offices | Monthly |

### Alert Levels

| Level | Criteria | Response |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Watch | Early indicators of displacement risk | Information to workers, communities |
| Warning | Imminent displacement likely | Pre-position resources, begin outreach |
| Active | Displacement occurring | Full program activation |
| Emergency | Mass displacement | Emergency Citizen's Royalty pilot, maximum resources |

### Notification System

- Workers in at-risk occupations receive information proactively
- Communities receive advance notice of potential displacement
- Retraining programs expanded in anticipation
- Resources pre-positioned before crisis

---

## Part IX: Funding

### Revenue Sources

| Source | Annual Amount | Reliability |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Automation tax (Phase 1-2) | $20-50B | Grows with automation |
| Reallocation from traditional UI | $30-50B | Stable |
| Employer transition contributions | $5-15B | Tied to layoffs |
| Federal general fund (bridge) | $0-50B | As needed |

### Cost Projections

| Year | Displaced Workers (est.) | Average Cost per Worker | Total Cost |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| 1 | 500,000 | $40,000 | $20B |
| 3 | 1,000,000 | $45,000 | $45B |
| 5 | 2,000,000 | $50,000 | $100B |
| 10 | 3,000,000+ | Declining (Citizen's Royalty scales) | $100-150B |

### Sustainability

As automation tax revenue grows and Automation Dividend matures:
- ADI becomes less necessary (Citizen's Royalty provides floor)
- Transition support becomes smaller share of budget
- Early investment prevents larger costs later

---

## Part X: Implementation Timeline

### Year 1: Foundation

- Pass Automation Displacement Insurance Act
- Establish Automation Displacement Board
- Begin employer notification requirements
- Launch first retraining partnerships

### Year 2: Scaling

- ADI fully operational
- First emergency Citizen's Royalty pilots (if triggered)
- Relocation assistance available
- Mental health services integrated

### Year 3: Refinement

- Assess ADI outcomes
- Adjust benefit levels based on data
- Expand successful retraining programs
- Close ineffective programs

### Years 4-7: Transition

- ADI integrates with emerging Citizen's Royalty
- Transition support narrows to retraining focus
- Emergency response capability maintained
- Shift to steady-state operations

## Conclusion

The transition to an automated economy will be measured in years, not decades. Workers losing jobs today need help today—not promises of a future dividend.

The transition support framework provides:
- **Immediate income** through Automation Displacement Insurance
- **Geographic flexibility** through relocation assistance
- **Future opportunity** through rapid retraining
- **Emotional support** through mental health services
- **Community stability** through local government support

The cost is significant but manageable. The alternative—abandoning displaced workers to poverty, addiction, and despair—would be far more expensive in every dimension.

We build the bridge while we build the destination.
