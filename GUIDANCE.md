## Introduction

This document provides frameworks for applying The Human Standard in various contexts. It is not a rigid set of instructions, but a guide for translating philosophical principles into practical reality.

Whether you are an individual, a community leader, a policymaker, or a technologist, these guidelines will help you align your actions with the core mandate: **Technology should serve agency.**

---

## Part I: Individual Application

### 1. Intellectual Foundation

**Strategy:** Deepen your understanding of the core philosophy.

- **Read the Manifesto**: Understand the distinction between Structural Agency and Metabolic Vulnerability.
- **Study the Policy Frameworks**: Move beyond slogans to understand the mechanisms (NIT, tiered transparency, sound money).
- **Engage with the Evidence**: Review `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` to ground your arguments in data.

**Why it matters:** A movement built on slogans is fragile. A movement built on understanding is resilient.

### 2. Personal Sovereignty

**Strategy:** Reduce vulnerability to coercion.

- **Financial Resilience**: Build an emergency fund. Explore sound money options to protect savings from debasement.
- **Cognitive Sovereignty**: Audit your information diet. Use tools that verify authenticity. Resist algorithmic manipulation.
- **Skill Adaptation**: Identify which of your skills are "functional" (automatable) and which are "vocational" (human-centric). Invest in the latter.

**Why it matters:** You cannot help others if you are drowning. Sovereignty enables agency.

### 3. Dissemination

**Strategy:** Spread the ideas, not just the organization.

- Share the repository with those capable of understanding it.
- Discuss the "Six Crises" (Automation, Trust, Monetary, Data Labor, Sovereignty, Existential) in your circles.
- Use the language of The Human Standard ("Agency," "Flourishing," "Citizen's Royalty") to frame debates.

**Why it matters:** Culture shifts when language shifts.

## Part II: Community Application

### 4. Local Resilience

**Strategy:** Build networks of mutual support.

- **Identify Allies**: Connect with local technologists, labor leaders, and community organizers.
- **Create "Third Places"**: Support or create spaces for human connection that are not mediated by algorithms.
- **Track Local Impact**: Document how automation is affecting your specific community. Local data drives local policy.

**Why it matters:** The national conversation is abstract. The community reality is concrete.

### 5. Institutional Advocacy

**Strategy:** Introduce Human Standard principles into existing institutions.

- **Schools**: Advocate for AI literacy and personalized learning tools.
- **Workplaces**: Push for "human-in-the-loop" policies and fair transition support.
- **Local Government**: Propose transparency ordinances for municipal AI use.

**Why it matters:** Institutions change slowly, then all at once. Be the catalyst.

---

## Part III: Political Application

### 6. Policy Advocacy

**Strategy:** Move the Overton Window.

- **Contact Representatives**: Demand clarity on their automation policy. Use the templates in `messaging/`.
- **Support Aligned Candidates**: Identify candidates who understand the Six Crises, regardless of party.
- **Demand Data**: Push for "Automation Impact Studies" at the state and local level. Transparency precedes regulation.

**Why it matters:** Politics follows culture, but policy solidifies culture.

### 7. Coalition Building

**Strategy:** Unite around principles, not tribes.

- **Bridge the Divide**: Show libertarians the property rights case for data dividends. Show progressives the justice case for Citizen's Royalty.
- **Focus on the Core**: "Technology serves humanity." This is the unifying banner.

**Why it matters:** A single-party movement will fail. A cross-partisan consensus will endure.

## Part IV: Professional Application

### 8. For Technologists

- **Build for Agency**: Design systems that enhance human control, not replace it.
- **Open Source**: Default to transparency. If it governs humans, it must be auditable.
- **Reject Manipulation**: Refuse to build "dark patterns" or addiction algorithms. Adhere to the Cognitive Sovereignty Bill of Rights.

### 9. For Educators

- **Focus on Agency**: Teach students to use AI as a tool, not a crutch.
- **Value the Human**: Emphasize skills AI cannot replicate—empathy, complex judgment, physical dexterity.
- **Lifelong Learning**: Model the adaptability required for the automation age.

### 10. For Leaders

- **Prepare Your People**: Be honest about automation trends. Invest in retraining.
- **Share the Gains**: Implement profit-sharing or transition funds if automation increases margins.
- **Human-First Culture**: Use efficiency gains to reduce burnout, not just headcount.

## Conclusion

The Human Standard is not a membership club. It is a lens through which to view the world and a compass for navigating the future.

If you act to preserve human agency, you are part of this movement.
If you build systems that serve humanity, you are building The Human Standard.

The future is not written. It is built.

**Build wisely.**
